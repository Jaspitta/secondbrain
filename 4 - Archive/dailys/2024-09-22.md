[[Euler's number]] is approximately 2.72 and is the number such that the function $y=e^x$ has a slope 1 at $x = 0$. To be more precise, if you draw $e^x$ the slope at $x=n$ is $e^n$ and since we know that any number to the power of 0 is 1, we get the previous definition. 
Remember that a [[slope]] of 1 is basically a 45 degree diagonal
