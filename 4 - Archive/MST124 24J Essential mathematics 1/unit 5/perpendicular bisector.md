If you imagine two points in a coordinate system and start drawing all the points that are [[equidistant]] from the two you end with a straight line that is [[perpendicular]] to the segment that joins the two points and is called [[perpendicular bisector]].
If we imagine two points where A is higher than B, we can start by finding the [[midpoint]] of the [[line segment]] (the segment that joins the two points) as we know that the line will pass for this point.
The coordinates are simply the coordinates of one of the points +- half the [[line segment]] which we can get with the [[distance between points in a plane]].
Finally the coordinates are $x1+\frac{x2-x1}{2}=\frac{x1+x2}{2}$ and same thing for the y.

From the [[straight-line graph]] you know two lines are [[perpendicular lines]] when the product of their [[gradient]] is -1 so the gradient of the line we are looking for will be $g of distance * g of bisector = -1 \rightarrow g of bisector=\frac{-1}{g of distance}$.

There is an alternative way to find the equation of the [[perpendicular bisector]], we know the points on this line have the same distance from the two points we have (a,b)(c,d). So we can use the [[distance between points in a plane]] to set the equation:
$\sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2}=\sqrt{(x-c)^2+(y-d)^2}$
