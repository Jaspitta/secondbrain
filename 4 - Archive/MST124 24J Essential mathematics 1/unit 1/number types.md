[[natural numbers]] also known as whole integers are the counting numbers, 1, 2, 3...

[[integer numbers]] are [[natural numbers]] to which we add negative integers

[[rational numbers]] are the once we can write as fraction

[[irrational numbers]] are numbers that exist but can not be represented as integers of fractions, like $\sqrt{2}$

all the above are grouped inside [[real numbers]]

To represent a [[rational numbers]], you take such number and multiply as much as necessary to remove the decimal part, 2.157 is $2157/1000$. 
However, [[irrational numbers]] like $\sqrt{2}$ do not have a terminating decimal part and therefore can not be represented as a fraction, this place them in a different category.
It is worth noting that there is an exception, numbers with a periodic decimal part, also called recurring, do not have a terminating value but can still be represented as fractions, making them [[rational numbers]], therefore, all numbers that have a terminating or recurring decimal part are [[rational numbers]].


a [[composite number]] is a number greater than 1 that isn't a [[prime number]] which in contrast is a number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself.
One of the core principles of arithmetic is that every [[composite number]] can be written as one and only one product of prime numbers
