inequalities in mathematics are statements used to usually describe some [[set]]s and is made of two expressions with an [[inequality sign]] between them (<,>,$\leq$,$\geq$).

If it is represented with x in the middle of two [[inequality sign]]s it is called a double inequality.

They are similar to [[equation]]s in many ways, but one thing that distinguish them is that [[inequality]] usually have either infinite solutions or no solutions. For this reason we define the solution to an [[inequality]] in the form of a [[set]] that is called a [[solution set]].

##### Rearranging inequality

Rearranging works similar to [[equation]]s but with some caveats. Swapping the sides and multiplying or dividing by a negative number require to swap the [[inequality sign]]. This also means that you should not divide or multiply both sides by a variable unless you know for sure that it can only take positive or negative numbers.

##### Lineal inequality

A [[linear inequality]] works very much the same way as a [[linear equation]]

##### Quadratic inequality

The same as a [[quadratic equation]] but with [[inequality sign]]. Since they are so similar, the approach to solving them is also very similar. You simplify and get all the terms on one side with 0 on the other and than you solve it by considering the [[function graph]]. This means you will need to deduce the shape direction, the x intercepts if there are and find which portion of the [[function graph]] satisfy the initial [[inequality]] (the x intercepts is because we rearranged the [[inequality]] to be 0 on one side).
Technically sketching the graph is not needed but at least in the beginning it can help greatly.

##### [[table of signs]]

It is an alternative method to solve [[inequality]], especially second and higher orders.
What you do is factorize the initial [[inequality]], build a table with the factors on the left and on the top the values for which the factors goes to 0 and the intervals around it. In each cell write + if the factor satisfy the interval and - if it does not.
At the last row you have the combination of the factors, find the sign using the once from the previous calculated one (where one is 0 write 0), finally take the intervals that satisfy the initial [[inequality]]

##### complex order inequality

You can use the [[table of signs]] to solve more complex [[inequality]], especially when you have fractions with variables in the [[denominator]].
You still start by arranging everything on one side and than condensing all to a single fraction to than do [[factorization]] where possible.
At this point you set up the [[table of signs]] as before but with the denominator as another term, you mark the interval where it is 0 as not usable and proceed as usual.
