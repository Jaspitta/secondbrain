all [[else statements]] fall under the same if and some languages require an ending [[else statements]] as a "==catch all other== possible scenarios" safety.

This [[code implementation]] may also allow to reduce the number of comparisons in the single if expression since we know that once we get to a certain one all the previous have failed (most relevant when we check if a number is in one of many ranges). Careful that this type of implementation makes the statementsâ€™s [[order dependent]].
