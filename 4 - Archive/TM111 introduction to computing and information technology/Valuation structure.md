There are three [[tutor-marked assignments (TMAs)]] all marked by your own tutor and three [[interactive computer-marked assignments (iCMAs).]]

The three [[TMAs]] count as 90% of your final grade and they are weighted as:

·        TMA 01          25%  

·        TMA 02          35%

·        TMA 03          30%

**There is a minimum threshold of 30% on TMA 03.**

The three [[iCMAs]] count as 10% of your final grade and they are weighted as:

·        iCMA41              2%

·        iCMA42              4%

·        iCMA43              4%.

Each assessment you complete is added to your [[Overall Continuous Assessment Score (OCAS).]] For example if you gain 50% for TMA01 that will add 12.5% to your OCAS score. You will need to have an ==OCAS of 40% or more and  a mark of at least 30% on TMA 03 to pass the module.==
