“Can you think of an example where changes in technology have resulted in changes to your work, social or family life? Have those changes improved your life? Have they created any problems?”


Well I work with the computer so without technology I would not have a job, but one thing that changed recently is work location. Although accelerated by the unfortunate event of the pandemic, technology has given us the possibility to [[work from home]] which gives a better experience for some aspects to the worker and also to the employer. The fact that I work from home is one of the biggest things allowing me to follow this university journey so in total it definitely improved my life. As we say in Italy though “Non tutto e’ oro quel che luccica” and there are definitely some drawbacks to this, for starter the feeling of separation between work and home is much thinner now, the home is also your office, plus working with koworkes 100% remotely makes it more difficult to establish that deep collaborative connection with them that can make working much more enjoyable


Wow he actually gave the same answer as mine.
