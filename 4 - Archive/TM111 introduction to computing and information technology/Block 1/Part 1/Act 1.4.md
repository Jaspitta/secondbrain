messaged between 2005 and 2014?
Which age group shows the biggest increase in the percentage of users between 2005 and 2014?
Can you offer any explanation for the increase in use amongst all the age groups?
 
Not very surprisingly the smallest change I think is in the older age group, but very close to that and very surprisingly there wan’t a big change in the younger generation since they started adopting the technology early on in 2005. On the other hand, the 55-64 age group sowed the biggest change, not much because everyone was using it in the end but mostly because very few people used it in the beginning so the change is actually relatively big. Overall, everyone use of the internet increase a lot but there are some pretty unexpected differences between age groups (at least I wasn’t expecting it), the reasons are mostly rooted into the mentality of the different generations, younger once are more used and born into technology so they are more likely to adapt quickly while older folkes already ave a much defined way of living their life and therefore are likely to change only if absolutely necessary


The answers provided where more looking at the graph in absolute numbers, so the biggest change is for the 25+ group while the 65+ saw the smallest, and the reason provided for the increasing adoptions is that phones and computers became more [[ubiquitous]]. The question, especially the last one specifies to look at the change among all the groups as one not compare the changes between groups so I need to be more carefull
