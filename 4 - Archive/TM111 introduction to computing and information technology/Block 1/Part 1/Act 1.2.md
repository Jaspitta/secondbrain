“Can you think of another technology that has made the transition from novelty to commonplace, like telephones and computers?”

The first thing that comes to my mind are cars, from horses to the first cars being for the elite and than thanks to ford finally becoming a common piece to own in every family. I a way maybe also air travelling, peoples do not own plains but taking one use to be for the absolute elite and there was no such thing as a section for the common class. On plains thought It is not clear weather it is more of a technological evolution or economic one


The answer suggested televisions, which is a really good one, much more technology oriented than mines for sure
