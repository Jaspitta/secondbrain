Relational databases represent a step forward compared to flat databases since they eliminate 2 major issues that are inevitable in flat databases. One is inevitably having many empty fields that waste memory and the other is making very difficult to update attribute values safely and efficiently.
With this in mind it is easy to see the shortcomings of flat database in action by looking at the Table 1 illustrated in the previous questions.
For the first problem, when we add a new Cruise, every Customer has to inherit the new attribute regardless of if he goes or not in the cruise, in the case he doesnâ€™t the attribute value is empty but the database has to hold information of the table structure taking memory.
For the second problem we can imagine that one of the Cruises is postponed by one month of or example, while this might not seem like a big problem in the small data set we have, it is easy to imagine how in a much bigger database with hundreds of thousands of records we would have to search for every single occurrence of that Cruise in the table and update it in the right way. This is extremely inefficient and prone to error making the Flat database inadequate for the problem.
A relational database tackle both this problems by separating the 2 entities and adding a table only dedicated to the relation between the 2, in this way adding a new Cruise will not translate to empty attributes on the Customers and editing one will always require to change a single record.
