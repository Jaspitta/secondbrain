The 2 entities I identified from the table are customers and cruises. They are suitable to be treated as separate entities since having them in the same table would mean that every time a cruise is added all the customers would have to get the new attribute even if empty resulting in a waste of memory, plus if one of the cruises were to change the month it would be very difficult to properly update all the occurrences for the right cruise. These problems make clear that the database is trying to represent 2 entities and their relation all in one table resulting in many problems and making it the perfect candidate for a relational database
