I read the material from the ebooks and use an app called Obsidian to draw and organise my notes. I first make a quick map reading the index. I then quickly read a topic and than reread more carefully, highlighting keywords. Next, I close the book and create a mind map without looking, then check it for accuracy and finally add the main points to the initial mind map.
