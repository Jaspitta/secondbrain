The first computer I had (my dad had it) was one of those big, white, plasticky PC whith one of those old mouse with the ball inside. I do not remember the brand but I think it was running windows XP or something, I remember playing pinball on it and loving it plus I still remember seeing floppy disks. If I think about desktops today I would say that apart from the crazy performance changes (It probably had less than 1GB of RAM) and the aesthetic changes both inside and out, I feel nothing much really has changed. We still use the internet to go on the web, write on files and store them (although now on someoneâ€™s else computer) and use a keyboard and monitor to interact.
