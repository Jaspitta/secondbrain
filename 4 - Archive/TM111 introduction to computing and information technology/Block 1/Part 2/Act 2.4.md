Engineers, linguistic and data entry people, mostly who had a strong interest and sense of login.
The biggest legacy is the view and use of peoples and computer holistically and building a system that placed people first and computers as tools to make the world better



In those days there were no programmers, so Simmons considered the transferrable skills that could be used in programming.
Therefore, he selected people who had skills in either languages or in logic for further training. In doing so, he inadvertently
made Lyons an equal opportunities employer in terms of programming.
I was a little surprised at the diverse roles involved in working with LEO even in those early days. People with expertise
in linguistics and logic were trained up as programmers, but there were also roles for engineers and data entry jobs.
Simmons' major legacy is the application of computers to business processes. His other important legacy is the holistic view
that users and the way they work are central to the use of technology in these processes.
