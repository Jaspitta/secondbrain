This is a type of [[coding problem]] that is in all essences a search in a list, and can also be reduced to a [[filter function]] since it filter all the items that match a [[search condition]].

An example is the [[find a value]] [[coding pattern]] where you want to find any value in the list that matches the [[search condition]] admitted there is one. In the case where the is no value is up to you to initialize the result variable to match such case.

Another variation of this type of [[coding problem]] is the [[find the best value]], where you have a criteria that define what is the best value and you look through the [[list]] while considering such criteria. In this particular case, if we assume that there is no possibility for an empty list we can initialize the variable to the first value.
