It is important more than ever for [[network]]s to be reliable, however, this work in the context of network has a deeper meaning.

We identify 4 components or metrics that make a [[network]] reliable:
- [[fault tolerance]]: the ability to continue functioning even when one or more single components fails. One way to accomplish it is [[redundancy]], adding more than one element that do the same thing but can replace the other if it fails. Another way is [[packet switching]], a message is divided into [[packet]]s and each packet is forwarded by the router separately based on the condition of the [[network]]
- [[scalability]]: ability scale with the users without affecting performance, usually achieved by following [[standard]]s and [[protocol]]s
- [[quality of service]]: mostly the ability to avoid [[network congestion]], when the demand exceeds the [[bandwidth]] available, or at leas the ability to manage it by prioritising important traffic
- [[security]]: both physical and digital, achieved with [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], [[availability]]
