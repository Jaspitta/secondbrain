This address is 255.255.255.255 and it is a special [[IPV4 address]] because the packet is transmitted to every device as long as it is in the same network.

Keep in mind that by default a [[router]] is not enabled to forward [[broadcast transmission]].

While a [[limited broadcast]] is sent to 255.255.255.255 a [[directed broadcast]] can be sent to all devices in a specific network so for network 172.16.4.0/24 the address would be 172.16.4.255.


A [[broadcast transmission]] transmission also exists in [[Ethernet LAN]], it uses the [[address resolution protocol]] to locate devices. This is called a [[Layer 2 broadcast]], it is sent to a known IP4 usually to discover the [[MAC address]] of the device or to discover a [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol server]] and get your IP configuration. Just like a regular broadcast the message is transmitted on all ports except the one coming from but in this case a [[router]] will not forward the message, only a [[switch]] will.
When a [[broadcast domain]] is too large, [[broadcast transmission]]s could significantly impact the performance, therefore the network is divided into smaller once called [[subnets]], this is done bye adding a router between the [[subnets]].

One thing to keep in mind is that even though a [[switch]] will broadcast a [[broadcast transmission]] to every port, even if that includes a [[router]], the [[router]] never propagate a [[broadcast transmission]] outside the [[local network]], for this reason it is also called a [[broadcast domain]]. For this reason it is common to use a [[router]] to divide a [[broadcast domain]] and avoid too much traffic
