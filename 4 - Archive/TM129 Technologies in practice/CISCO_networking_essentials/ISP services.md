An [[Internet Service Provider]] provide the link between a home [[network]] and the [[internet]]. Different [[Internet Service Provider]]s connect in a hierarchical manner to ensure always the shortest path available.

To back up all of the [[internet]] there is the [[internet backbone]] which is a collection of high speed [[fiber optic cable]]s that connect metropolitan areas around the world, even across seas.

The interconnection between different [[Internet Service Provider]]s is very complex but for the final user it seems like a very simple process. The most basic way to connect to an [[Internet Service Provider]] is with a [[modem]]. This is not very secure and the most common thing is to have a [[router]] that provides security and [[IP addressing]] information.

The most common ways to connect is with cable, usually offered by cable television providers, signal is carried on the same coaxial cable as television and require a special [[modem]] to separate the signals.
The other common option is [[DSL]], also require a special [[modem]] that separate DSL signal from telephone signal. Runs over the telephone line and split the line in three channels, voice telephone, download data and upload data.

Other less common connection options are [[cellular]] which uses the phone network, is generally good but can result in additional charges. [[satellite]] which is a good option but require direct line of sight so in areas with lots of constructions or trees can be a problem, finally a [[dial up telephone]] that uses the [[telephone line]] and a [[modem]], is generally slow but cheap
