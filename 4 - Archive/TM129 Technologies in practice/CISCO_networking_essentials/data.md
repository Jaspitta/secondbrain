Data in it's rawest form is information that you create and share consciously or not. In particular we differentiate [[volunteered data]] as the data that you intentionally create and share like comments and interactions, [[inferred data]] which you generate with your action but not intentionally like when you make a purchase and [[observed data]] which is data that is observed about you like you location.

On a more technical note, data is a combination of [[bit]], the smallest unit of data a computer can process which can at all times be either on or off. Every interaction with a device or a piece of hardware is processed and translated into bits for the [[CPU]] to read, data coming from the computer on the other hand follow the reverse process.

Even though a computer can only represent numbers as 0 and 1, we can convert those numbers to letter using a [[standard]] and the most common one is the [[American Standard Code for Information Interchange]] ([[ASCII]]).
Using different standards we can represent every time of information simply using numbers.

Once data is converted in bits it can be sent across the [[network media]], that is the physical medium of the network. The most common are [[electrical signal]], [[optical signal]] and [[wireless signal]].
