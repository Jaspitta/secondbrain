A function tied to the same uses of the [[append function]] and other [[function]] that operates with [[list]], [[list generation]] and similar [[coding pattern]], in particular this is an implementation of the [[list filtering pattern]].

When using this function, unlike the [[append function]], you usually generate a list starting from an existing one and keeping only the values that satisfy a specific condition.

One particularity of using this [[function]] in a [[coding pattern]] is that when testing or writing [[list tests]] you have both a minimum (0 values) and maximum (the size of the original list) value of the list that you have to consider.
