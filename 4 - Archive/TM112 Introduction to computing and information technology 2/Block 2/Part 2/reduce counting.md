It is a type of [[list problem]] that involves a [[list]], a [[reduce function]] and the necessity to count the number o items in the list.
Usually in a real [[coding problem]] this is in conjunction with some other problem like a [[filter function]] where you want to find the number of items that match a [[filter function]] condition.

Sometimes this is also referred to as a [[coding pattern]] instead of a problem.
