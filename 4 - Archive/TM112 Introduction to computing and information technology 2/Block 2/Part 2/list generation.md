A [[coding pattern]] concerned with working with lists, normally an evolution of the [[sequence generation problem]] where the generated sequence is stored into a [[list]].

There are different ways to generate a list:
- [[append function]] which add a value to the end of the list
- [[filter function]] to only keep values that satisfy a condition
- a [[transform operation]] which convert items from input list to output list
