A [[list operation]] that is often used in [[list problem]] is the the [[reduce function]] which involves reducing the [[item]] in a [[list]] into a single element.
There are different approaches and uses of this [[function]] and the most important [[list problem]] are:
- [[reduce counting]]
- [[reduce aggregation]]
- [[reduce retrieval]]

These three types of problems but all [[list reduce problem]] in general can be recognized and implemented with the same [[coding pattern]] where you have at least one [[loop]] and three variables, one for the list, one for cycling and one for the aggregated result.
