As we saw many times while going through [[coding pattern|coding patterns]] and [[coding problem]], almost all the times a [[coding problem]] does not fit perfectly in a single coding pattern but is usually a combination of many or at least a variation of one.
What often end up happening is that one [[coding problem]] is made of many sub-problems and each of them can be solved separately, the output of one is than the input of the next. In some cases the sub-problems are of the same [[problem type]] but many times they are not.

So a bigger problem can be reduced down to smaller once, but you still need to identify which sub-problems are relevant for the [[coding problem]]. Often to do this it is convenient to work backwards, starting from the output you find which problem will give you that, than you find which problems can give you as output what you need for the previous one as input and so forth.

The key concept here is that practice makes perfect and [[problem solving]] is an extremely hard skill that need to be developed and while there are some general good practices that you can follow, there is no guarantee that those will apply to the next problem you have to face and you will therefore have to adapt your strategy for every problem you encounter
