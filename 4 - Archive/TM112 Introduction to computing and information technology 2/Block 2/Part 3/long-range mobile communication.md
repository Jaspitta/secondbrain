This type of communication is concerned with making it possible for devices and [[smartphone|smartphones]] to connect and communicate all over the world.
The basic idea is to have small [[networks]] where moving [[smartphone|smartphones]] connect and disconnect, these small networks talk to each other to manage the transitions and make even longer range communications possible via cabled nets.
The basic principles of these type of [[networks]] remained the same, single devices connect to a [[base station]] via [[radio waves]], the base station coordinates what is called a [[cell]] (a small network basically) and also route traffic outside if necessary.
Even if the base principles remained the same, the demand grew exponentially over the years and the older technologies have been replaced by much newer and sophisticated once.

Due to the incredible demand, the new generation of communication technology is already being planned. In particular the latest and greatest is [[5G]], which promise to deliver incredible speeds, higher coverage and lower power consumptions
