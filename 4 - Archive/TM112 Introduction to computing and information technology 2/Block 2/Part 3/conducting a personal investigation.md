conducting a [[personal investigation]] is a process that require different phases and organization.
The steps we need to take are:
- [[planning]] -> think ahead of what you want to do and what you need to achieve it, if you need to identify categories make sure they capture the right things and overlap as little as possible and also keep in mind how are you going to collect the data
- [[recording]] -> execute on your planning to collect the data and adjust the recording if needed
- [[analyzing]] -> analyze the data based on what you decided to look for in the planning process, this could mean [[find an average]] or [[find a range]]
- [[write a conclusion]] -> add a conclusion after analyzing the data, you should create a summary and add comments of surprising findings or ideas on improvements
