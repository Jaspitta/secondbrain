Ideally, [[smartphone]] and [[mobile technologies]] in general should be usable everywhere and anywhere, but we all know that this is not the case and for many reasons:

- weather: thick and thundery clouds create interference
- overload: too many people at once
- outage: no power
- jamming devices: criminal activities
