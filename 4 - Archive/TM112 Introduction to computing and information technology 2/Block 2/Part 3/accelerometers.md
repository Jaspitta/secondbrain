An accelerometer is a [[MEMS]] device, specifically it detect some [[smartphone]] movements and gestures.
Accelerometers works on the principle of [[inertia]] and [[electrical capacitance]], it is made of a moving part suspended by springs and a fixed part that measure the change in [[electrical capacitance]] (ALL ETCHED ON FUCKIN SILICON WTF THAT IS INSANE). When the [[smartphone]] is moved, the inertia of the moving part will move it closer or further from the fixed part producing the [[electrical signal]].
To measure acceleration on the 3 different axis you simply use 3 [[accelerometers]] placed in 3 different orientations.
Normally this sensor is used to detect orientation, small movements and gestures to than make available features like gesture controls or [[turn to mute]].
However, [[accelerometers]] are not always accurate at detecting change in motions, especially when the [[smartphone]] is already moving and therefore we use [[gyroscopes]] to aid in such situations.
