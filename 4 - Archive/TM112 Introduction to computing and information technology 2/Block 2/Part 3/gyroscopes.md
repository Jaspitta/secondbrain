It is a sensor that detect how quickly an object rotate ([[rotation]]), a common application is to minimize camera shake.
As we saw it is also common to see them used in conjunction with [[accelerometers]] to get more precise measurements.
In practice these are [[MEMS]] sensors called [[Coriolis vibratory gyroscope]].
