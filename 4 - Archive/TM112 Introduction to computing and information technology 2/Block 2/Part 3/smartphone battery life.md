All the very new and powerful [[smartphone components]] that we love take lots of power, in addition we also want this and light [[smartphone|smartphones]] which makes very difficult to produce lasting batteries.
One way to help is to turn off high-draining components when not used, this can be partially done by the user and partially by the [[smartphone operating system]].
Another option is to increase the power of [[smartphone batteries]], the current standard is [[lithium-ion batteries]], there is some research for different type of batteries but they all seem not feasible at the moment. Another big problem is that too powerful batteries might actually be too dangerous to be carried around in the pocket.
The next option is to reduce [[charging time]], this also depends on the technology of the battery, there are several researches in the making and some very promising once like from the [[MIT]] which uses [[nanotechnology]], however none of the options available is still close to being commercially available.
Another idea is to harvest energy from the environment, like sun, friction, water and more, however the energy collected from these technologies is still way too small at the moment.
