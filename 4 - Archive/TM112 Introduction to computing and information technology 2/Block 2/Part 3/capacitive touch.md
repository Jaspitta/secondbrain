It is the technology to detect finger interaction with a [[touch screen]] that has replaced [[resistive touch]] and become the norm
As the name implies it uses an electrical property called [[capacitance]] which measure the charge a device called [[capacitor]] can hold.
In particular this technology works by placing two thing glass sheets facing each other and on the facing side a thin layer of a transparent conductive material is places ([[indium tin oxide]]). The two layers form a grid of [[capacitor]],  a voltage is applied to the grid and when the finger make contact some of that voltage is transferred to the finger, the grid is then scanned and where the voltage differ is where the finger touched.

The big advantage is that there is no bending in the hardware which therefore is more durable, however, the touching object has to be conductive so dry skin or gloves will not work.
