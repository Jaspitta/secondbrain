It is a force that is best described as [[inertia]] for objects moving in a circular motion.
An object placed on a rotating disc will move with it when it start spinning, the speed of the movement depends on the revolutions and the distance from the center. If, while the disc is spinning, we move the object closer to the center, the velocity of its movement has to slow down, this means that it experience a negative acceleration. As we saw with [[accelerometers]], when the acceleration change, the object respond with an [[inertia]] in the opposite direction, in the case of an object in a circular motion this [[inertia]] is called the [[Coriolis force]] and it is what is measured by [[Coriolis vibratory gyroscope]].
