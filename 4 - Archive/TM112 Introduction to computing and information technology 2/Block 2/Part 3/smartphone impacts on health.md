As we know [[smartphone|smartphones]] use electromagnetic waves, the same that your microwave oven uses, although with far less power.
This has caused lots of concern to the possible implications on health, many institutions conducted extensive research, and in October 2014 the [[World Health Organization]] deliberated that there are no health effects established.
With that being said, there are still conflicting studies on the subject, for example there are studies that shows that men keeping a [[smartphone]] in the pocket at all times have a lower sperm count, and also that the presence of a mobile phone close is enough to keep you distracted and perform worst in cognitive activities.

One health risk that is attached to [[smartphone]] and is indisputable is the improper use of them, as in use at the wrong place and time.
The most common example is usage while walking or driving around which is extremely dangerous, most people do it, yet everyone agrees that is very dangerous and annoying.
Some cities around the world are taking action to prevent the dangers and [[Honolulu]] in 2017 became the first city to introduce fines for people that walk while looking at the phone.

We also need to consider that health is also [[mental health]] and socials relations are a big part of that. One major critique risen to [[smartphone]] is the continuous [[phubbing]] that it encourage, [[phubbing]] comes from phone and snubbing and it is the action of always checking or using your [[smartphone]] to the point of ruining your social experiences.
