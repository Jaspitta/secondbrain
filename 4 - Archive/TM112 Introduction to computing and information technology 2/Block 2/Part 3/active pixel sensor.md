It is a sensor found in [[cameras]] and more specifically in [[smartphone|smartphones]]. The quality of the sensor determines the quality of the picture and usually the size of the sensor determines the quality, the bigger the better.
Sensors are made of a 2D grid of pixels, each [[pixel]] has a [[photodiode]], each one is a small [[electric component]] sensible to light. The grid is attached to a [[control circuit ]]which can read and reset the status of the [[pixel]].
The dimension of the grid determine the pixels in it, and therefore the resolution of the image and the [[aspect ratio]].

Regular [[pixel|pixels]] are only able to detect black and white images, to get a [[coloured image]] you need a sensor that can detect at least the [[primary colours]]. It is very hard and expensive to create a pixel with 3 [[photodiode]] in it, therefore usually for coloured sensors 3 pixels are used, each one capture one of the 3 primary colours and than the result is aggregated into one.
