It is a phone that has much of the capabilities of a computer, it has powerful hardware, an [[operative system]] that allows to download and run software ([[mobile application]]), sensor to understand the world around and the capacity to connect to the [[internet]].
There are many seemingly different smart devices like tablets and smart watches but the technologies behind them all are extremely similar.

Historically smartphones started as big as house bricks and than got smaller and smaller, to the point of getting to small and become hard to use. Since 2007 the trend reversed and phones started to become bigger but slicker particularly thanks to [[touch screen]], which also brought the creation of [[GUIs]].

One of the key (but maybe not so much anymore) features of [[smartphone|smartphones]] is of course the ability to communicate, there are many ways to do this and there are some [[communication technologies for mobile devices]] that are more important than others in general.

Although [[smartphone]] and mobile devices in general have become the norm, and the technology behind has gotten very sophisticated, there are still some challenges and issues that to this day represent an obstacle for this type of devices:
- [[smartphone coverage]]
- [[smartphone battery life]]
- [[smartphone impacts on health]]
