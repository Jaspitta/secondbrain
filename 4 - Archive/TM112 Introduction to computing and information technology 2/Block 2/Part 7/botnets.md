A specific type of [[malware]] that infects a machine and than tries to spread as much as possible to others. Infected machines are called zombies and the net is called botnet or zombie army.

Initially they where of the [[client-server botnet]] type where machines are under control of a primary server (sometimes more than one). With time, having commands coming from a few machines became vulnerable to be tracked, therefore [[peer to peer botnet]]s are born. Each infected zombie hold a list of piers, some machine called [[botnet commander]]s introduced a [[command]] and such is distributed to all the piers.

The damages that a botnet can do are of the most varied type but often they are some time of [[email spam]] where the zombies send emails, [[click fraud]] to simulate interaction with ads, [[brute force decryption]] via the zombies, [[bitcoin mining]] and [[DoS attack]]s.
