hacking is a terms that refer to the actions protracted by [[hackers]], at the very core it means someone with great expertise in the [[cyber security]] field that is using such knowledge.
With time it became mostly associated with negative and illegal actions that break the [[CIA]] of data and are done with criminal intentions.

Usually [[hacking attacks]] happens in phases, each one is different but in the famous attack of [[Cleaver]] we saw:
- initial attack: use of [[hacking techniques]]
- targeted attack: with the information stolen in the previous part they used [[spear phishing]] and [[whaling]] to attack people.
- final attack: from the previous phase the victims where convinced to download a malicious software (unknowingly) called [[TiniZBot]] which is a type of [[backdoor]] that could [[log keystrokes]] and clipboard, take screenshots and disable security software.

When an attack such ask the [[Cleaver]] leaves companies exposed for prolonged periods they are called [[advanced persistent threats]].

Hacking can be done to get money, to subdue competition, but is not uncommon to see it also used for political reasons especially in extreme governments since it is a much cheaper and more deniable way of action compared to military.
