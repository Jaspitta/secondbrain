a contraction of malicious software is one of the biggest threats to the world of computers, it usually aims at extorting and getting hold of data to access private information and ask a ransom, this specific type of malware is called [[ransomware]].

There are many types of malware, the three biggest categories are:
- [[virus]]: a program with an [[infection mechanism]] which look for victims, [[a trigger]] which is usually when an application is run and a [[payload]] which consists in the virus copying itself to corrupt data, create backdoor and more. Even when not harmful it is still a danger because it consume resources
- [[worm]]s: similar to a [[virus]] but spread via [[network connection]]s
- [[trojan]]: have the goal to take access of a computer, they are masked as regular applications but containing a destructive [[payload]]
- [[botnets]]: malwares that spread and take control of all infected machines

Malwares need a way to get into your computer and [[hackers]] will try to take advantage of every possible [[vulnerability]]. The two areas subjected to exploitation are:
- [[human factor]]: a practice called [[social engineering]] which takes advantage of human emotions and behaviors
- [[technical factor]]: weaknesses into software or hardware like [[zero day bug]]s

One of the most common ways of defending yourself from [[malware]]s is [[antivirus software]] which detect and manage [[malicious software]] using either [[malware signature]] which is an identifier that tracks known [[malware]], however new [[virus]]es need time for their signature to be public and some of them can change it, the other way is using [[malware heuristics]] which is a type of [[heuristics]] where the [[antivirus software]] decompile the program and look for typical malware instruction or run the program in a [[sandbox]] and analyze the behavior.
