It is an extremely important piece of information that allows to verify the process of [[authentication]].

Passwords are hidden during communication using [[encryption]] and when stored using [[hashing]] with one of its [[algorithm]], sometimes they are also encrypted after [[hashing]] before storing them.

Since they are so important, they are also often the target of [[cyber attacks]] and there are three ways that passwords are stolen:
- [[brute force attack]]: the attacker tries all the possible combinations in order. It can be very time consuming and prevented by limiting the allowed failed attempts.
- [[dictionary attack]]: the attacker purchases a [[dictionary file]] which is a file with the most common passwords plus a big amount of stolen passwords, all the words in an atlas, sometimes with numbers in it, and more. If an attacker has access to the hashed passwords he can also hash the dictionary to find matches
- [[non technical attack]]: all the other attacks like stealing postit with passwords in the office, trying common passwords or names of relatives and installing [[keylogger]]s.

While there are ways of attacking and stealing [[password]]s, there are also ways to protect them:
- [[password manager]]
- [[two factor authentication]]: security is managed in two pieces, the password and another component like [[hardware security token]] that generate an [[OTP]], an [[OTP]] sent via an app or message and more
