They are the what the [[interpreter]] read and use to manage objects in [[RAM]] for you, it can be a [[python function]] or any [[programming function]] as well as any object that you declare.

This means that by entering a [[programming expression]] in the [[python shell]] the [[python interpreter]] will give you the memory representation of such [[programming expression]], we say that the [[programming expression]] evaluate the object, for these reasons we say the [[interpreter]] fill the gap between objects in memory and expressions in the code.

A programming expression can also be a simple statement like 1 or ‘hello’, it these cases they are called [[expression literals]].

Expression types:
- [[variable expressions]]: simply declare amvariable
- [[expression literals]]
- [[constructed expressions]]: made of more expressions like \[1, 2, 5]
