Localisation in general is the act of determining the location of something or someone in a specific way.
There are many ways of achieving this, the most used is probably [[global positioning system|GPS]] but it is not the only one.

Another famous and old technique is called [[triangulation]] where you locate a nearby peak and you can set up at two different known position to measure the angles they create with the peak, at this point you can use [[trigonometry]] to calculate the distance from the peak.
A similar approach is [[trilateration]] where you measure the distance and direction from points you can see and draw lines from them, the point where these lines meet is your location.
Both [[triangulation]] and [[trilateration]] are sometimes referred to as triangulation or even just localization even though they are technically a type of [[cell-tower localisation]], they are also one of the way that [[cell-tower]] use to determine your position even without [[GPS]].
