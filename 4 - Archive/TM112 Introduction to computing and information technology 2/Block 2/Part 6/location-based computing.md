  - location-aware computing

It is a form of [[computing]] where computing devices detect the current location and act upon it with the intent of delivering [[location-based services]].

We define the process of gathering the location as [[localisation]], if the [[location]] belong to a known coordinate system and a geographical location it is called a [[geolocation]] and the process of detecting it [[geolocalisation]].

When converting from [[geolocation]] to a human readable address we call the process [[reverse geocoding]] and when converting from human address to [[geolocation]] it is called [[geocoding]].

There are many different ways of using [[location-based computing]] and delivering [[location-based services]], among them the most relevant are:
- [[geofencing]]

Generally speaking there are also many ways of categorizing [[location-based services]], what usually is employed are [[classsification schemes]] and [[taxonomies]]. One of the most prominent is described in an academic paper and consists of imagining [[data objects]] as the area of interest and [[query objects]] as the subject being tracked. The [[classsification schemes]] than categorize based on which of the objects are moving and which are stationary.
