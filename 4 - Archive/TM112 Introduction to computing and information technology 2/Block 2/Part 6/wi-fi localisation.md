Just as [[cell-tower localisation]], also wi-fi can be used similarly, while [[cell-tower]] have [[Cell ID]], [[wi-fi router]] have a [[MAC address]].

The [[MAC address]] does not have [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] information in it, however there are global databases that hold pairs of MAC to physical coordinates.
This are better than nothing but not necessarily accurate or correct, if you move your [[router]] there is no way for them to know.

wi-fi can also be used in itself to identify near access points and possibly locations, there are two modes of doing this:
- passive mode: [[access points]] broadcast a message and the device listen. High battery drainage
- active mode: the device broadcast its locations. Low power usage but anyone listening can read it.
- scanner mode: the device capture [[wifi]] traffic and listen for [[MAC address]] passing in the channel.
- logging: services you share your location with will probably log it.
