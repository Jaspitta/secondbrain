It is a type of [[localisation]] that uses beacon and is normally used to signal that you are entering an area where a service might be available.

It works with [[bluetooth beacon]]s, one is installed in a specific location and the id is associated with such place. When the phone passes, an app can pick up such id and lookup for the location, if it matches it might send notifications of promotions or similar.
Another, more helpful use, is to assist peoples with low vision.

When a device get the signal of a [[bluetooth beacon]], other than the ID it gets the benchmark power value that we can combine with the actual power value to calculate the distance. Therefore, if we have three beacons connected we can use the same technique as in [[GPS]] to draw three circles and calculate our position.
There is always a degree of error in such calculations, therefore the result is more an area than an actual point.
