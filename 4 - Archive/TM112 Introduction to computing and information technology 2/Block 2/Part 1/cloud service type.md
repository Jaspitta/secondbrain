Every [[cloud service]] can be categorised into a type which differ from the level of [[abstraction]] in the same way that [[cloud layer]] does and are defined into the [[NIST]] standard.

The first step is [[packaged software]] where all you get is the software and everything else is up to you and is not even considered cloud per the [[NIST]] standard.
The next step is [[IaaS]] which means basically outsourcing the hardware components. You do not have to pay and maintain hardware, do not have to pay professionals, get free scalability and pay only for what you use. Another advantage is the ability to create and destroy testing environments so easily.
The next step is [[PaaS]] where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and the first software layer like the [[operating system]] and the [[runtime environment]] while the customer still has to manage data and applications. PaaS providers offer additional pluggable services and monitoring, usually the customers are companies that want to offer cloud based applications and businesses that require intense processing of large amount of data from different data sources.
Finally we have SaaS which is when an application action is completely hosted and managed by the cloud provider and sometimes this also includes version control. This is the form of [[cloud computing]] you are more familiar with as a customer.
