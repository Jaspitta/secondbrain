In [[cloud computing]], not all clouds are created equal, we are used to think that the cloud is a murky amalgamation of many data centres where there is no clear physical devices. This is not wrong, this is actually the definition of [[public cloud]] which is the cloud that everyone uses, especially for [[cloud backup]], where [[cloud providers]] spread their [[data centres]] in multiple location also to comply e with privacy and protection laws. 

The other side of the coin is [[private cloud]], where devices may or may not be on the organisation premise but it is always only available for the organisation and usually of much smaller scale. Also for this reason some people argue that by the [[cloud computing definition standard]] these are not even real clouds.

Then there is [[community cloud]] which is a form of [[cloud computing]] offered by one or more organisations to a group of people with common concerns and can be very varied in structure and organisation.

Finally there is the [[hybrid cloud]]  which is a composition of different types of cloud that is also getting very popular for organisations that want privacy but also require the [[scalability]] of [[public cloud]].
