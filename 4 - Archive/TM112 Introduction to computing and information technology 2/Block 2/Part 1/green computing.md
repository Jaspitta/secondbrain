Green computing is the computing practice that is concerned with making every aspect of computing as green as possible, from design to usage and everything else.
[[cloud computing]] has faced its fair share of debates on wether it should exists or not from an environmental perspective.

There is no denying that data centers consumes lots of energy but we have also to asks what are the alternatives, how efficient are they and where does this energy come from.
For these reasons entities like [[Greenpeace]] judge cloud providers based on many metrics and also very important on how transparent they are on their consumptions.
Another metric that is not so obvious is [[water usage]], data centers needs water of quality similar to drinking one and therefore can be a problem in areas that have already a shortage like California for example.

Many different entities placed lots of pressure on cloud providers to provide transparency in water and energy usage (only fair tbh).
There are 2 main indexes used to judge how well this companies are doing:
PUE ([[power usage effectiveness]]) which is the ratio of energy used to energy delivered to computing equipment and WUE ([[water usage effectiveness]]) which is the ration of annual water consumption to to energy delivered to computing equipment and in both cases a high number is bad.
We need to remember that this metrics are also dependent on the climate, a warm and humid location will require much more energy and water to keep the environment cool and dry
