There are many type of averages, each with their own pro and cons but usually the calculation of them falls in the type of the [[reduce aggregation]] pattern.

The [[mean]] is one type of average, calculated by summing the numbers and dividing by how many numbers there are.

The [[median]] is a type of average more suited for data that does not mirror a real world quantity and is simply the middle value when the numbers are sorted. If we have an even amount of data we take the middle value (the [[mean]] of the two)

The [[mean]] and the [[median]] are both cases of central tendencies, they summaries where the "center" of the dataset is.
