In [[data analysis]] correlation or the study of correlation is the study of finding and describing a relations between two or more datasets.
It still is a form of [[reduce aggregation]] [[list reduce problem]] but this time starting with more than one list.

A good way of visualizing correlation is a [[scatterplot]].

Correlation is not an yes or no question, two sets can be more or less correlated and there are different way to express the strength of the correlation. The most common one is the [[correlation coefficient]] which is a number represented usually with `r` that goes from -1 to 1.
The max value 1 indicates that the datasets are strongly [[positively correlated]], the -1 that they are strongly [[negatively correlated]] and finally a value of 0 shows that there is no [[correlation]] at all.
