It is a type of [[averages]] calculated by summing the numbers and dividing by how many numbers there are.
One particular case is the [[mean with percentages]], what you do is assume that you have 100 entries (to satisfy the percentage), than multiply the value of the entry times the percentage and finally divide by 100. If you have that 29% of people voted 2 stars, that alone is worth 29 x 2 stars so 58. This is because it is like you have 29 times 2 stars to count in the list of 100 values.

There are objections in using the mean, particular when it is used on numbers that do not directly represent a measurable real world quantity (we can't say that a person happy 10 is twice as happy as one happy 5). For these cases it is more recommended  to use a [[median]]
