The skew is another property used in [[data analysis]], usually seen together with the [[mean]] or [[median]] and is somewhat similar to [[dispersion]].
It is used to describe the distribution of data but unlike [[dispersion]] it express an uneven distribution to the right and left. We say data is [[right skewed]] when the data present a long tail to the right and therefore we can also say it is a [[positive skew]].

skew can be measured as a specific number but is very rarely done so, usually it is much more useful to simply describe it as [[right skew]] or [[left skew]].

Since the skew represent and uneven distribution, a strong one can create distortions when we try to express an [[averages]], for these reasons using the [[mean]] is strongly unadvised and  the [[median]] is the better choice since it actually split in half the numbers by definition.
