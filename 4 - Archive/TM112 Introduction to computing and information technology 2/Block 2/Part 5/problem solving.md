Problem solving is an activity that has been carried out since forever by humans and animals. Even though humans took problem solving to the extremes, until recently we just worried about doing it, only the "recent" science started to worry about how to do it better and study the subject more and more.
[[George PÃ³lya]] is the pioneer of such science, his book [[How to solve-it]] opened the door to such field. In his idea, problem solving was made of 4 stages:
- understand the problem: get a clear idea of the starting point and where to get
- make a plan: make an algorithm, this is where [[heuristics]] apply
- carry the plan: write and test the code
- look back
