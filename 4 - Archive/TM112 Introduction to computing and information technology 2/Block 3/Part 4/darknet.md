All the internet pages that you normally access via a browser and are indexed by conventional search engines are part of the [[surface web]].
There is however an enormous amount of content outside of such boundaries in what is called the [[deep web]] accessible via links that you can find in pages from the [[surface web]].

Even further there is a whole part of the internet made of sites not accessible via a regular web browser called the [[darknet]] that can have many good and bad uses and leveraged the [[tor network]] with the [[tor browser]].

The most notorious sites are called [[hidden services]] and can be reached only using [[onion links]]. This are special addresses that end in .onion and are generated from the [[hash]] of the [[public key]] of the [[server]] hosting it and can not be resolved to an [[IP]] by a [[DNS]].
Exchanges with such servers works in the same way as usual in the [[tor netword]], however, there is no [[exit node]] and the traffic never go through the conventional internet.
Some of these can be good, like places where testimonies can drop their stories maintaining their anonymity while others can be terrible like [[darknet marketplaces]].

They use the [[tor network]] to maintain anonymity and [[cryptocurrency]], in particular [[bitcoin]], to allow transactions for illegal things like guns, drugs, assassins and more.
The most famous is the [[silk road]] website, created in 2011 by [[Ross Ulbricht]], a libertarian physics. It felt like a legitimate website with reviews, customer support and more, but sold mostly drugs, for a total of 1.2B $ that earned commissions of up to 20k per day to Ross. In the end it raised the attention of the [[FBI]] and the website got taken down forever
