The [[RIPA]] 2000 is the current legislation regulating the use of [[encryption]] in the UK, it ensures the right entities can access plain text versions of encrypted conversations without undermining the rights of citizens.

- Part III
	It is a very big legislation in which Part III is destined to legislate [[encryption key]] disclosure, in particular, which bodies can request access to keys, how, when, and the consequences of not providing them.
		- [[Section 49]] is called Notices requiring disclosure and state the circumstances under which a person may be forced to provide keys after being presented with a [[Section 49 Notice]]
			- subsection 1. list the circumstances under which [[Section 49 Notice]] can be used and the entities that can demand keys
			- subsection 2. a key can required only it is believed the suspect has it and there is no other possibility
			- subsection 3. list the possible reasons for demanding keys
			- subsection 4. how to serve the [[Section 49 Notice]]
		- [[Section 53]] lists the penalties for not complying with a [[Section 49 Notice]]
			- subsection 1. state that the persecuted must know he has received a notice
			- subsection 2. state the persecuted must be in possession of the key before receiving the notice. This presents problems:
				- authorities must demonstrate the person has the key
				- the accused can rebut the claim but has give some evidence
				- authorities can rebut but have to demonstrate 'beyond reasonable doubt' the person has the key
			- subsection 5. list the penalties for not complying, in part A lays out the prison terms and in B allow a higher penalty for particular cases
		- [[Section 54]] list that the receiver of a [[Section 49 Notice]] may be forbidden for informing anyone and explain the reasons and penalties for such secrecy particularly in subsection 4


Implementation of Part III was delayed until 2007 and received many push backs fro large organizations but in the end it passed without many changes
