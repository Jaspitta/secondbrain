The [[tor network]] is often considered to be fully anonymous and impossible to break but that is not totally the case.
There are leaked documents from the [[CIA]] that states that it will be impossible to [[de-anonymize]] all users and all traffic on the [[tor network]] no matter the effort.
However, there have been researches done that used [[AI]] in which if you have control of a [[guard node]] you can use pattern recognition to identify the address of some [[servers]] hosting some sites. [[guard node]]s changes all the time but this means that with a good effort is possible to identify some [[servers]] used by some users some of the time (not great but better than nothing). The [[tor network]] and the [[tor browser]] is not static, [[tor node]]s change all the times and the network itself also is updated by developers making it harder and harder to conduct [[de-anonymization]]

A similar situation has happened with [[bitcoin]], by definition of the [[blockchain]] every transaction ever done is recorded and traceable, even though there is no need to provide identification to use [[bitcoin]]s, it's network work with [[peer to peer]] connections via [[bitcoin client]]s, therefore it is possible to recover the [[IP]] of those connections and therefore who was using the [[IP]] at a specific time.
In a study the [[University of Luxembourg]] managed to find 60% of the [[IP]]s used when they where monitoring the network, however this caused a noticeable slow-down in the [[network]].
Since this is mostly a problem with [[bitcoin client]]s, developers have been finding ways to make the network more secure making always more difficult to conduct [[de-anonymization]].
