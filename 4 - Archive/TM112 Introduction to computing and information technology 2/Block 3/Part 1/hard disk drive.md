Made of 3 disks called [[platter]] covered by a metallic coating that can be magnetized. Each [[platter]] is spaced and on top of each there is a head that moves and read or magnetized the part that is interacting with (reading and writing). These 3 disks spin on a central spindle very fast (7200 rpm is the standard).
Since they are disks, the spots on the edges move faster than the center, therefore can be red/written faster.

To store [[data]] into an [[hard disk drive|HDD]] it needs to be organized by a [[file system]] and to prepare it for such task we need to [[formatting|format]] the disk. The area that will be destined to this [[file system]] is called a [[partition]].
By default, [[HDD]] are divided into sections called [[tracks]] which are concentric portions.
