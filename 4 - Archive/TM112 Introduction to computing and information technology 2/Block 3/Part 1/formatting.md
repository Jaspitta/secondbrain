It is a process that prepare a [[partition]] for a specific [[file system]] which usually means for a particular [[operating system]].
[[hard disk drive|HDD]] are divided into concentric portions called [[tracks]], however, they are still to big for files and therefore they are segmented into equivalent portions called [[sectors]].
[[sectors]] are areas of [[tracks]], they are arc-shaped and usually have the size of 512 bytes. They are grouped into [[HDD clusters]] and one is typically made of 4/8 sectors and due to the size it is common for a single [[file]] to take more than one [[cluster]].






Formatting can help also to remove errors and [[virus]] as a last resort.
