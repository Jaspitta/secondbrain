It is the counterpart of the [[hard delete]], here a file is not physically deleted but only hidden or obscured for a potential recovery.

In [[Windows]] files inside the recycle bin are soft deleted, the file name is appended with a $R and a $I is generated containing [[metadata]] about the soft deleted file, this can be used to recover such file if necessary.
