It is a process that slows down the read and write operations on a disk.
When there is little space available, the [[operating system]] and the [[file system]] try to store files in more than one [[HDD clusters|HDD cluster]], ideally the use contiguous cluster but this is not always possible and the file is split in [[HDD clusters]] in different locations.
The [[HDD head]] has to move to all these locations to read or change a file and therefore the operations get slow.

It is possible to format the [[hard disk drive|HDD]] to have bigger [[HDD clusters]] and it will help with fragmentation plus reduce the space for indexing needed by the [[file system]] but it will also greatly increase the overall slack space

One post-problem solution is to try to perform [[HDD defragmentation]] on the disk.
