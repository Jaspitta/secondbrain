It is an [[Algorithms]] that can be used to [[hashing]] something else and produce a [[hash code]] (called [[checksum]] when we do it on a file). The core concept is that we should get a code for a representations of what we have that is unique, one way and pure (from same input we have always same output). In the internet it is in fact used to prove the authenticity of a file, you publish the [[file]] along with its [[checksum]] and others can recalculate it from the file to check the authenticity.

The most simple algorithm is to simply sum the value of the ASCII characters, to avoid anagrams having the same value we could also weight the digits sequentially. The risk for [[hashing collisions]] still remains (two different inputs giving the same output), proper hashing algorithms are very complex, they also use [[modulus operator]] with large prime numbers to reduce the output size, they use [[logic operations]] and all with the goal to reduce [[hashing collisions]] although they are impossible to be fully removed and could be exploited for criminal purposes.

Hashes has many [[Algorithms]] old and new, usually the name comes from the number of [[bit]] in the hash but the final result gets represented always as a [[hexadecimal]] number.
