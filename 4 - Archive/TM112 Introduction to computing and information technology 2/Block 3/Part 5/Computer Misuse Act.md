In 1979 a new piece of technology was created in the UK and it was called [[Prestel]]. It was the pioneer of many of the things we give for granted today like news, weather data, financial results, emails, online banking and more. It was incredible but too ahead of it's time and ended up failing for it's too high costs.

In 1980s two guys saw a [[Prestel]] engineer use a specific username and [[password]] combination to access the [[Prestel]] network and decide to steal it to get inside and access private information.
[[Prestel]] accused them of unauthorized access in 1985, they where charged under the [[Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981]] but in 1988 the [[House of Lords]] declared that no law existed that regulated such behavior and they where therefore not charged.

After such accident it became clearer than ever that a [[legislation]] was required to regulate unauthorized access to computers and in 1990 the [[Computer Misuse Act]] 1990 was born as a [[parliamentary bill]] and later the same year came into effect

#### Content and Intent

The legislation has three main sections that define three offences of growing gravity, unauthorized access to a [[computer]], adding the intent to cause further offences and finally modification of [[computer]] material.
It is worth noting that most of this legislation, to be found guilty there need to be proof of [[intent]] which is defined as the desire to perform the crime plus the attempt or action to do so.
The simple act of designing a way to get unauthorized access is not against the law if you do not act on it, in the same way gaining access accidentally will not imply an intent.
Another important note is that the [[legislation]] does not define a [[computer]], therefore it is valid for every [[computer]], even the once not designed yet at the time of the publication.

#### Section 1

section 1 outline the offence of unauthorized access. It defines it as the intent to gain access, not being authorize and knowing so.
The punishment is a fine and/or prison, minor offences are called [[summary conviction]] with max 1yr prison and/or max 5000$, major once are called [[conviction on indictment]], require a jury and have at most 2yr of prison and/or a fine 

#### Section 2

Related to what is called as [[aggravated offences]] so the crime in section 1 was done with the intention of using the [[computer]] or data for a further crime.
It has five subsections:
1. to commit section 2 you have to commit section 1 and one of section 2(2)
2. list of crimes covered by section 2
3. the second offence does not need to follow immediately
4. persecuted even if there was no way of being successful in the attempt of the second crime
5. list the punishments, up to 5 years

#### Section 3

Cover the cases where damage is done by modifying the content or the operations of a [[computer]], DoS, [[malware]] etc. The harm has to be intentional (a bug is not persecuted) and can be an [[aggravated offence]].
The damage does not need to be actual, the intent is enough and the punishment can be 12 months of [[summary conviction]] and up to 10 years when there is a jury, plus a fine.

With time, like most [[legislation]]s the [[CMA]] was amended many times due to the introduction of new laws and new technologies, the two biggest changes are the introduction of section 3A and 3ZA:
- 3A: allows to persecute who create software designed to cause a crime with up to 2yrs and a fine. There are many critiques by security professionals since many of the tools to test the security of a system they use can also be used for criminal activity
- 3ZA: crimes that affect human lives, nations, economy and national security. This punishes the most serious crimes like deaths and more, the punishments start at 14yrs up to life sentence and a fine
