In the UK in particular the story of protecting citizen privacy start in 1981 with the first privacy law. The biggest problem with the first law was the missing of regulations regarding data internationally, and for this reason in 1984 the [[Data Protection Act]] 1984 was born requiring organization to store personal data in specific databases.
The [[Data Protection Act]] 1998 made finally explicit the protection of personal data and was lastly superseded by the [[Data Protection Act]] 2018 with the [[GDPR]].

The [[GDPR]] has the goal of harmonizing data protection for all [[EU]] members but also leaves flexibility on its implementation for each country. On of the main advantages is for businesses that know that as long as they comply with the [[GDPR]] they are not breaking the law, the same goes for foreign businesses operating with data belonging to EU citizens.

For the [[GDPR]] each country has to have a [[Supervisory Authority]] and in the UK it is the [[Information Commissioner's Office]]. It also require every company with more than 250 employees to have a [[Data Protection Officer]] and forces companies to report data breaches in 72 hours time.

The [[GDPR]] also introduced its own version of the [[right to erasure]] which allow people to have data removed if it was acquired illegally of if the privacy of the individual is considered more important than the interests of the organization.
