The [[Data Protection Act]] was born in 1984 and changed a few times up to the final version we have today that is the 2018. Even if it started as a standalone piece of [[legislation]] and it was the second one regarding protecting [[privacy]] and [[personal data]] in the [[UK]], it is now closer to an implementation of the guidelines described by the [[GDPR]] which regulate such laws in all the [[EU]] members. In fact the [[Data Protection Act]] at its core include the sever core data protection principles required by the [[GDPR]]:
1. Lawfulness, fairness and transparency: data should be collected only if needed and must be made clear how the data will be used. Also data need to be fairly used and not only for personal profits. There are six lawful basis for processing data and are consent, legal contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task and legitimate interest.
2. Data should be obtained for one or more specified purposes
3. Only data necessary for those purposes should be asked
4. Should be kept up to date
5. Data should only be kept for the time needed
6. Data should be kept safe also when processing
7. Data owners should be able to demonstrate compliance

It is important to note that violations of the [[Data Protection Act]] are not persecuted like regular crimes, instead they are take care of by the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] which can assign fines up to 4% of turnover or 20mln.
Also, although your information is protected, not all data is, for example data about dead people or pets is not under the [[Data Protection Act]]. However it also define data that could represent a risk for the individual like religion, sexual preferences and more as [[sensitive data]] and therefore protect its more seriously.

The [[Data Protection Act]] also define the processing of data as any action involving it and invite entities that use it to consider the risk looking such data impose. For example many companies specify the requirement of deleting data from a computer when changed and also the specific method of deletion
