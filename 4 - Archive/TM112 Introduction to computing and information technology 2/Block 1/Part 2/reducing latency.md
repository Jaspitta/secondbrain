Most of the uses of the cloud involves using an internet connection or at minimum a network of some sort. The biggest bottleneck in a network tend to be [[latency]], the time it takes for one [[data packet]] to get to destination and back.
It should be clear than that lower latency will provide users with a better experience and [[cloud provider]] with a competitive edge.

When it comes to using cloud services [[latency]] is not the full picture, as a user what you care about is [[response time]], which is the equivalent of latency + [[processing time]].

There are many technologies being developed, offered and used to reduce [[response time]], [[cloud provider]] move servers closer to the customers, [[caching content]] locally, offering [[dedicated network]] access and the newest is [[edge computing]] or [[edge computing|fog computing]]
