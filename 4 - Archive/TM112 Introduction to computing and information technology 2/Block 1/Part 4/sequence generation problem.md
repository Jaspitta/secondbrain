It is a [[coding pattern]] that involves generating values one after the other until a [[stopping condition]] occur.
Usually the problems involve the use of either a [[while loop]], [[do while loop]] or [[for loop]].
The pattern also assumes that the sequence is not empty and that each variable depends from the previous one plus an offset.
This problem can be decomposed to initialise a sequence, define termination condition and generate next value. 
When it comes to the termination condition it is important to be careful of not causing an [[infinite loop]]
