Cases patterns are [[coding pattern|coding patterns]] where the problem presents a situation where 2 or more cases could be possible as the next step.
This type of problems always include the use of a [[boolean expression]] to handle the [[branching]], if the expression is true we move in the first case, otherwise (else in coding terms) the second by elimination. Notice that which case to go into is interchangeable, if one case is in the true section of the boolean expression, we can switch the expression and move the case into the false section getting the same result. ==However==, you should use an intuitive order, particularly when there are more than 2 cases since it makes much simpler to check for errors or forgotten cases

Notice that the cases pattern does not have to have only 2 possible solutions, it is possible to have many solutions and it can be implemented in the simplest way by using multiple [[if-else statements]].
However, one assumption that we make is that the inputs fall exactly into only one cases and therefore all of them are [[mutually exclusive conditions]].
When multiple cases exists you should always keep in mind that it is a [[good practice]] to avoid doing unnecessary checks (this in general not only for the cases pattern), therefore, if the instructions are mutually exclusive in the best case scenario only 1 is checked. There are different ways of achieving this, they also depend on the language used, there are [[execution flow statements]], [[switch case statements]], [[nesting if statements]] and [[else if statement]].
Regardless of which one you use, remember that the goal is to get the job done in as few instructions as possible
