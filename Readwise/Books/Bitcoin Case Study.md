- Summary: Bitcoin is a digital currency that uses a technology called Blockchain, which is a public ledger of all transactions to prevent fraud. It operates on a system where users can validate transactions through a process known as "proof of work," which involves solving complex mathematical problems. The concept of Blockchain is being explored for various uses beyond cryptocurrency, making it a significant technological advancement.

## Highlights
### 1.1 Bitcoin
- one of the most exciting applications of these technologies (View Highlight)
#### 1.1.1 What is an electronic currency?
#### 1.1.2 The problem with electronic currencies
- A message may be deleted from the sender’s computer once it has been received, but there is no reason why that data *must* be destroyed. (View Highlight)
- a user *could* send an electronic coin to another user *and* keep a copy (View Highlight)
- named the double-spend problem (View Highlight)
#### 1.1.3 Bitcoin’s mysterious origins
- The paper described a new electronic currency running on a peer-to-peer network that not only avoided the double-spend problem, but also did not require a centralised authority to issue currency and manage transactions. (View Highlight)
- Nakamoto’s identity remains a mystery. (View Highlight)
##### Bitcoin takes off
- 2009 when Nakamoto released an application that allowed people to exchange Bitcoins and create new coins. (View Highlight)
- a Bitcoin user in California called a pizzeria near Hanyecz’s home and arranged for delivery in exchange for 10,000 Bitcoins – then worth approximately $30. (View Highlight)
#### 1.1.4 Using Bitcoin
- a cryptocurrency – a form of finance that uses strong encryption for security. (View Highlight)
- Bitcoin offers further security to users by obscuring their real identities (View Highlight)
- Bitcoin users are not completely anonymous; with a great deal of effort, payments can be traced back to an individual (View Highlight)
- Alice’s Bitcoin application starts the transaction by creating a message (View Highlight)
- Alice’s wallet then signs the message using her private key. (View Highlight)
- The message is then broadcast to every Bitcoin user. Any user can authenticate the message’ (View Highlight)
- Bob’s wallet application places the Bitcoins in his wallet. (View Highlight)
- The exchange needs to be validated by other computers – a process that usually takes about 10 minutes. (View Highlight)
- the most important part of Bitcoin – the Blockchain. (View Highlight)
##### The Blockchain
- Bitcoin radically differs from previous electronic currencies is that it does not need a central trusted third party to authenticate transactions. (View Highlight)
- Nakamoto proposed a distributed ledger – a record of every Bitcoin transaction that has ever occurred (View Highlight)
- every Bitcoin user can keep and authenticate their own copy of the chain. (View Highlight)
- A ledger is an accountancy term for a record of financial transactions (View Highlight)
- Blockchain is built from blocks of completed transactions. (View Highlight)
- each block contains some unique identifying information together with the SHA-2 hash of the previous block in the chain. (View Highlight)
- These hashes allow Bitcoin to avoid the double-spend problem. (View Highlight)
- transactions include the addresses of senders and recipients and the amount of money (View Highlight)
- by working backwards through the Blockchain, we can not only validate *every* Bitcoin transaction that has ever taken place, but also know precisely who owned every Bitcoin at every moment in time. (View Highlight)
- Whilst Chuck has edited his copy of the Blockchain, he cannot edit the chains belonging to other Bitcoin users (View Highlight)
- Where the network contains multiple, different Blockchains, it chooses the most widespread (View Highlight)
#### 1.1.5 Completing a transaction
- Alice’s transaction has been sent to every Bitcoin user, where it joins a pile of pending payments in a block. Once enough of these transactions have been made, the Bitcoin system will finalise the block and add it to the end of the ever-growing Blockchain. (View Highlight)
- finalising a block takes the form of a competition between computers (View Highlight)
- to find a SHA-2 hash for the block whose value is smaller than a preset target. (View Highlight)
- Bitcoin requires each computer to add a random 32-bit value (known to cryptographers as the nonce) (View Highlight)
- and then compute the hash. (View Highlight)
- If a nonce generates a hash equal to or less than the target, the computer shares its nonce with every computer on the network. (View Highlight)
- the block is validated and locked. (View Highlight)
- added to the blockchain. (View Highlight)
- If the hashed value is larger than the target, the computer chooses a new nonce and rehashes again. (View Highlight)
- computers must mine suitable nonces, testing billions of possible values every second (View Highlight)
##### Proof-of-work
- Mining is an example of a proof of work – a piece of data that is computationally laborious to produce but quick to verify. (View Highlight)
- proof of work can be used to reduce spam mail by forcing email clients to perform a relatively time-consuming calculation before they can send a message. (View Highlight)
- The Bitcoin network validates one new block approximately every 10 minutes. After 2,016 blocks, the network decides if the target value should be altered. (View Highlight)
- If fewer computers are validating blocks, or if the problem is taking too long to solve, the target is raised (View Highlight)
- if blocks are being validated more quickly (by more miners or faster computers), the target is lowered (View Highlight)
- Currently (summer 2017), validating a block is worth 12.5 Bitcoins, but the reward is gradually decreasing; it is halved every 210,000 blocks (View Highlight)
- they can also earn Bitcoins (or fractions of Bitcoins) by validating transactions for other users (View Highlight)
#### 1.1.6 The blockchain is the future
- Bitcoin is unlikely to replace conventional money soon (View Highlight)
- most tangible contribution will be the principle of the blockchain (View Highlight)
- the principles of a distributed public ledger can be applied to any type of transaction where there is scope for fraud or error (View Highlight)
