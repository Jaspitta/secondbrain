## Highlights
##### Introduction
- In the early 1960s, when computers were extremely expensive, a number of companies offered a service called utility computing. In return for a charge per use, they would run your programs and store your data on their computer, which you would access with a terminal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv5vrha92e8f2tdzjs8psjjb))

#### 1.1.3 Types of cloud
- an anonymous, unknown location that is shared by many unrelated users. In fact, this is a pretty spot-on description of a public cloud ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvg5dx6pyax2rhpk0e60c2sy))

### 1.2 The cloud for businesses
#### 1.2.1 Cloud architecture
- a mechanism to allow multiple users to access the same physical resources ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvjqzc6gtdj668w7vn58h3qa))
- The virtual machine form of virtualisation takes the resources of a single physical host computer (CPUs, memory and input/output devices) and divides them into multiple virtual machines ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvjr09ekqx3nsa0f7ab3c3kz))

- customers may want to access different levels of service ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvjrw0n71t5mwb12b8zq1gy3))
- The lowest layer is the infrastructure layer and is mostly composed of the physical kit ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvjrwj72k067jhh5y6d6f9j2))
- The middle layer is the platform layer and provides an interface between the applications and the infrastructure ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvjrww18zft2w63wpr7rpc4j))
- the top layer, sometimes called the application layer, includes the data and applications ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvjrx6kvah5msempbbp5frb4))
##### Pizza as a Service
- In this analogy, the ‘infrastructure’ is the raw ingredients of the pizza ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvkre84cea34j1rfns9b39qq))

- most PaaS providers add value by way of pluggable services such as authentication and authorisation, email, user interface components, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvqwsy8wfntde4mx78jcc4m2))
- particularly useful for companies that build and deploy software applications that run in the cloud ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvqwv5tm7b36z1vpqcrygt5g))
- for businesses that rely on simulations that require intensive processing of data that comes from a large number of distributed sources ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvqwvx00sw19cmzc1bjnvzm5))
