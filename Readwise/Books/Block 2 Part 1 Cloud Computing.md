## Highlights
##### Introduction
- In the early 1960s, when computers were extremely expensive, a number of companies offered a service called utility computing. In return for a charge per use, they would run your programs and store your data on their computer, which you would access with a terminal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv5vrha92e8f2tdzjs8psjjb))
- in 1968, when Douglas Engelbart demonstrated what an individual could do on their very own computer ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv5w1fddzcc1tp6zb9b754ht))
