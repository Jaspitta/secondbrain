- differentiating between what we can change and what we can’t. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=183))
- time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects is time not spent on the things we can change. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=185))
- “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=187))

- Education—reading and meditating on the wisdom of great minds—is not to be done for its own sake. It has a purpose. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=201))

- Even harder is saying no to certain time-consuming emotions: ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=213))
- the more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes to the things that do. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=218))
- Control your perceptions. Direct your actions properly. Willingly accept what’s outside your control. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=232))
- Having an end in mind is no guarantee that you’ll reach it—no Stoic would tolerate that assumption—but not having an end in mind is a guarantee you won’t. ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=244))

- It’s not by eliminating outside influences or running away to quiet and solitude. Instead, it’s about filtering the outside world through the straightener of our judgment. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=316))
- However, if our judgments are crooked ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=318))
- then everything that follows will be crooked, ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=319))

    - Note: The past is what we judge ourself on. For this reason we look at ourself, our human ability and proclivity for evil matched with our self conciousness and asses that if we do not or did not do what was best we are evil, we do not change and we do not deserve help, not even from ourself.

- That is the role of wise people in our lives—to serve as model and inspiration. To bounce our ideas off and test our presumptions. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HNJIJB2&location=588))
