## Highlights
- Motivation is the fire that starts burning after you manually, painfully, coax it into existence, and it feeds on the satisfaction of seeing yourself make progress. ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=89))
- Humble beginnings can create the perfect foundation for success, because starting at the bottom creates almost endless opportunities to enjoy small successes. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=101))
- Motivation is something you get, from yourself, automatically, from feeling good about achieving small successes. ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=110))

- the real source of consistent, lasting happiness lies in the process. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=153))
- successful people set a goal and then focus all their attention on the process necessary to achieve that goal. They set a goal and then, surprisingly, they forget the goal. ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=159))
- To accomplish anything worthwhile, and especially to achieve a goal others say is impossible, you have to work your ass off. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=176))
- Actually, motivation is a result. Motivation is the pride you take in work you have already done—which ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=204))
- And then I realized I would never get better if I didn’t (1) accept the fact that I had failed and (2) work really hard to improve. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=289))
- Confidence comes from preparation. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=296))
- Confidence is a feeling, but ultimately confidence is the result of knowing that you’re not only willing to do the work, but that you actually will do the work. You won’t try to hack your way to success. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=316))
- if you can do one thing well, you can do lots of things well. You realize that all you have to do is find the right process, ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=331))
- Declaring what we want to be and how we will get there causes us to feel we are further along the path of becoming who we want to be—even though we have in reality done nothing but talk.* Have you done that before? ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=410))
- They seem to have exceptional willpower, but not because they actually have more. Instead, they’ve learned how to best use what they have. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=425))
- mental toughness builds the foundations for long-term success. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=431))
- Successful people are great at delaying gratification. Successful people are great at withstanding temptation. Successful people are great at overcoming fear in order to do what they need to do. (Of course, that doesn’t mean they aren’t scared; that means they’re brave. There’s a huge difference.) Successful people don’t just prioritize; they consistently keep doing what they have decided is most important.

- Success → Motivation → More Success → More Motivation → More Success = Becoming ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=487))
- You’ll stay motivated when you find a process you trust and commit to working that process for as little as a week. Forget how far you need to go to reach your goal; just commit to following the process for a week. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=494))
- What happens when you turn “I want to” into “I have to”? You make it to work on time. ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=528))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- Punctuality is nonnegotiable. Getting to work on time is not a goal; it’s a task. So is making dinner; you have no choice. So is taking care of your kids; it’s nonnegotiable. Going to the gym, on the other hand, is a goal. We may want to work out ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=528))
- Your routine isn’t something you choose to do; it’s just what you do. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=534))
- The distance from here, where you start, to there, where you someday want to be, is too great, especially at the beginning. ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=550))
- Your process is what you do to make your goal happen. ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=569))

- Everyone has goals. The people who actually achieve their goals create routines. ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=582))

- In each case the distance from here to there seemed so great that you decided to forget about the end goal and just focus on the process. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=614))
- Dream big. Set a huge goal. Commit to your huge goal. Create a process that ensures you can reach your goal. Then forget about your huge goal and work your process instead. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=616))

- (Remember, the main purpose of a goal is to establish the right process and routine to achieve that goal.) ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=624))
- you will never be able to give yourself positive feedback when you constantly compare yourself with your end goal. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=662))
- If your process is one designed to get you where you eventually want to go, all you have to do is work your process—and ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=665))
- We’re instinctively drawn to people who are modest, agreeable, polite, kind . . . in short, to people who are genuinely likable. ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=729))
- Likable people already know what they know. They want to know what other people know. They ask questions. They ask for details. ([Location 739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=739))
- That makes the people they meet feel important. ([Location 741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=741))
- Taking responsibility when things go wrong instead of blaming others isn’t masochistic; it’s empowering—because ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=746))
- The only way to form genuine relationships is to stop trying to impress . . . and start being yourself. ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=753))
- Interrupting isn’t just rude. When we interrupt someone, what we’re really saying is “I’m listening to you not so I can understand what you’re saying; I’m listening to you so I can decide what I want to say.” ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=754))
- the only thing you really control is you. People who try to control other people—tell them what they should do, what they should think, what they should feel—have decided that their goals, their dreams, or even just their opinions are more important than everyone else’s. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=761))
- Be the person who has accomplished very cool things . . . but manages to make other people feel like they are the ones who have accomplished very cool things. ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=768))
- When another person makes a mistake, see that as an opportunity to be kind, forgiving, and understanding. ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=773))
- Keep checking off those boxes. Within a few days you’ll start to embrace those small successes. ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=801))
- You get to choose your goal—but after that, what you want to do is irrelevant. What matters is what you need to do to achieve your goal. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=820))
- You can’t get promoted without outworking everyone around you. ([Location 824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=824))
- So don’t start unless you’re truly willing to pay the price. ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=825))
- Set your goal. ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=833))
- Set aside decision anxiety and choose a reasonably promising routine. For now, just pick a process that matches your current fitness level. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=837))
- A good process tells you precisely what you need to accomplish at every step along the way. ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=850))
- Setting a clear and specific target for each day’s effort automatically supports feedback: Either you did what you planned to do (great!) or you didn’t (boo!). ([Location 854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=854))
- Look at the process you created and determine what changes you need to make to your current daily routine so you can reliably work that process. ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=863))

- Just take the training plan you found and put it on a calendar. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=865))
- don’t compare yourself with other people. Don’t worry about whether you’re as fast as your neighbor; you probably won’t be. Don’t worry about whether you’re as fit as you were in high school; you definitely won’t be. The only thing that matters is that you can check off the box beside each day’s activity. ([Location 875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=875))
- when you do check off each box, take a second to congratulate yourself. ([Location 878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=878))
- Something won’t work, and when that happens, what usually gives first? Your new process. Instead of giving up, fix whatever schedule problems have arisen. There is always a way. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=889))
- Always wait until you can evaluate real results before you modify your process. Don’t assume you somehow know better—let the data show you what is better. ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=904))

- decisions are behavioral change killers, so eliminate as many decisions as possible. ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=966))
- The Hawthorne effect works: When we know we are being observed, we instinctively change our behaviors. In this case, of course, you will be the one doing the observing. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=987))
- Inevitable success is the best success of all—and it will happen when you set your goal, forget your goal, and focus on working your process. ([Location 1011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1011))
- If the only thing you care about is making money, no matter how much money you make, it will never be enough. ([Location 1024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1024))
- If you want to amass significant wealth but you aren’t willing to give up your current job—or spend your nights and weekends building a side business with considerable potential—your approach is the problem. ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1077))
- You can’t just open a corner restaurant and hope to become super wealthy. ([Location 1085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1085))
- So what is the best way to say no to yourself? It’s easy: Stop saying “can’t” and start saying “don’t.” ([Location 1100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1100))
- According to the researchers, “The refusal frame ‘I don’t’ is more persuasive than the refusal frame ‘I can’t’ because the former connotes conviction to a higher degree. ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1116))
- When you “don’t,” you automatically start to find ways to ensure you do—because that is the person you have become. That is the person you are. ([Location 1131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1131))
- Use “I don’t” to ensure that what must be nonnegotiable remains nonnegotiable . . . and then shift to terms you are willing to negotiate. ([Location 1142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1142))
- Work too hard on any one aspect of your life and other aspects suffer. That’s why it’s so hard to be world-class at anything . . . much less at several things. ([Location 1192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1192))

- the people who can synthesize and blend and apply a broad base of skills to a variety of functions and problems are the people who are most valued. ([Location 1201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1201))
- Imagine someone asks, “What do you do?” How do you answer? Maybe you say, “I own a restaurant.” Or “I’m a supervisor at a manufacturing facility.” Or “I’m a teacher.” Whatever you say, your answer probably doesn’t include the word “and.” But it should—even ([Location 1236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1236))
- Don’t say, “I can’t afford to spend the extra time on an ‘and.’” You can’t afford not to spend the time. If your “and” is professional, then you create a buffer against downturns, shifts in market conditions, or the loss of a job. ([Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1262))
- And later, when you look back at it, it looks like a finely crafted novel. But at the time, it don’t [sic].”* ([Location 1270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1270))
- It doesn’t matter what “and” you choose, as long as it is something you really want to do. ([Location 1283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1283))
- The only thing holding you back is you—and your willingness to try. Try something. Try anything. ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1298))
- There are two types of pain you will go through in life: the pain of discipline and the pain of regret. Discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1322))
- How happy am I? How successful you feel is based solely on your answer to that question—and ([Location 1353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1353))
- The more money you want to make, the less happy you may need to be. ([Location 1367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1367))
- But don’t automatically say that your family and friends are the most important thing in your life. If they are, that’s great, but if they’re not, and yet you’re spending the bulk of your time and focus on those relationships, then you’re only cheating yourself ([Location 1375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1375))
- you can have a lot more than you currently do, whether what you want more of is professional or personal success. So start pursuing the goals that will make you happy. ([Location 1390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1390))
- It’s impossible to feel fulfilled and happy if you aren’t taking care of your basic needs. ([Location 1410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1410))
- Are You Comfortable Financially? ([Location 1440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1440))
- If you’re constantly worried about or thinking about money, your first goal must be to generate more income, because money clearly matters a lot to you. (And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.) ([Location 1444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1444))
- Are You Relatively Fit and Healthy? ([Location 1447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1447))
- Make sure you’re taking care of your basic needs first—otherwise, no matter how much you may “want” to achieve another goal you choose, you won’t. ([Location 1456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1456))
- When your goal benefits you in only one way, it’s much easier to quit, especially when the goal you set is something you want but do not need to do. ([Location 1490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1490))
- If you are in financial straits or relatively poor physical condition, your goal must help you overcome that challenge. ([Location 1508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1508))
- In the dictionary the word “idea” is categorized as a noun. But “idea” should really be a verb, because an idea does not actually exist until you turn your inspiration into action. ([Location 1518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1518))
- You certainly won’t get it right all the time, but if you let “idea” stay a noun, you will always get it wrong. You will never achieve your goals if your approach is to wait. ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1545))
- Be “unrealistic” when you set a goal, and then be realistic about how you will achieve that goal. ([Location 1554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1554))
- Interruptions are productivity killers, so letting people know you’re doing something special and will be out of reach for a day is an absolute must. ([Location 1579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1579))
- Set a concrete target. Commit to working for twelve hours, or however long a time frame you choose. ([Location 1599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1599))
- Once you decide a task should take four hours, it somehow ends up taking four hours, even when it should actually have taken only two hours. It’s natural to fill extra time with “stuff.” ([Location 1607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1607))
- Start at 4:00 a.m. Or indulge your inner night owl, starting at 6:00 p.m. and working through the night. Either way, those first few hours will fly by. ([Location 1616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1616))
- On an EPD, keep the music turned off for the first few hours. That way, when your motivation starts to flag, a little music will provide a great boost to your morale. Whatever ways you typically tend to “treat” yourself, think of those treats as personal productivity bullets.

- Speaking of food, plan meals wisely. Don’t take an hour-long lunch break. ([Location 1629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1629))
- You will definitely need to take breaks, but those breaks should reinforce your sense of activity and accomplishment. Pick a few productive tasks you like to perform—and gain a sense of accomplishment from—and use those for your breaks. ([Location 1635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1635))

- after a few EPD—maybe even just one—you’ll perform better every “normal” day as well, because you will have unconsciously shut down that little voice in your head and raised your own performance bar. ([Location 1680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1680))
- The key is to create structure and discipline for your week. Otherwise you’ll let things happen to you instead of making things happen. Otherwise you’ll let “urgent” push aside what is truly important. ([Location 1695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1695))
- Go a step further and block out time to complete specific tasks. ([Location 1698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1698))
- Assigning realistic time frames forces you to prioritize. Assigning realistic time frames also helps you stay focused. When you know a task should take only thirty minutes, you’ll be more aggressive in weeding out and ignoring distractions.

- Multitasking is a personal-productivity killer. Don’t try to do two things sort of well. Do one thing really, really well. ([Location 1716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1716))

- If you want to succeed, you can’t make excuses. Forge ahead. Establishing great habits takes considerable time and effort. Success and achievement are habits, and it’s incredibly easy to instantly create a bad habit by giving in, even just once.

- Without achievement, there is no motivation. There are just excuses. ([Location 1766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1766))
- To succeed, hear the criticism, take the shots, endure the laughter or derision or even hostility—and stick to measuring yourself and your efforts by your own standards. ([Location 1771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1771))

- Successful people finish—unless there’s a very, very good reason not to finish, which, of course, there almost never is. ([Location 1801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1801))
- Successful people are successful because they do things differently from other people. See? Obvious. But also true. To achieve differently you must act differently. ([Location 1806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1806))
- Yet they’re the same people who complain because they don’t get opportunities, don’t make enough money, don’t get promoted . . . basically because they get treated like every other employee. But they act like every other employee. ([Location 1812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1812))

- Willpower isn’t something you either have or don’t have. Willpower is sometimes a function of necessity. (There are lots of things you can do when your back is against the wall and you feel you have no choice.) More often, willpower is a function of success. It’s easy to stay the course when you feel good about what you’re accomplishing. ([Location 1862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1862))

- It’s also easier to make a smart choice when the decision isn’t right in front of you. Pick easy decisions that will drain your store of willpower tomorrow, and make them tonight. ([Location 1887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1887))
- You have the greatest amount of mental energy early in the morning. Science says so: ([Location 1900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1900))
- Eat healthy meals. Eat healthy snacks. Not only will you feel better, but you’ll also make better decisions—and you’ll be able to exercise more willpower in making those decisions. ([Location 1913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1913))

- Most successful people do feel that good luck played some role in the success they enjoy. But they don’t wait for good luck or worry about bad luck. They act as if success or failure is totally within their control. ([Location 1956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=1956))

- Do yourself a favor and use the “work your number” approach to get started on that goal. Every day, commit to doing one—or more, if you choose—of the following until the list is complete. When you’re done, you may not yet have a thriving business, but you will have laid the groundwork. And you can feel good about having done something that many people dream about but never do.

- “I have never seen a great leader that didn’t have the generosity gene. Take care of your people, let them know where they stand, cheer them, never take credit for what they do, and they’ll go to the moon for you.” When you think about it that way, deciding to use your generosity gene every day is an ideal way to work your number. Want some tips? Work your number by giving. ([Location 2286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=2286))
- Whenever possible, give the people around you the autonomy and independence to work the way they work best. When you do, they almost always find ways to do their jobs better than you imagined possible. That applies to your friends; if you ask someone for a favor, let them decide how they will deliver what you need. And it definitely applies to your kids; ([Location 2295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=2295))

Whenever you can, whether you’re a boss or not, help other employees gain skills or experience that will help them land the job they someday hope to land, even if that job is with another company.

- And if you are a boss, employees will care about your company only after you have shown you care about them. One of the best ways to do that is to not just say but show that while you have hopes for your company’s future, you also have hopes for your employees’ futures. ([Location 2355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=2355))

- While you may never be as good, when superstar performance is your bar, you automatically set your goals higher—and that makes you achieve more. Stop comparing your present self with your past self. ([Location 2678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZYFR2CL&location=2678))
