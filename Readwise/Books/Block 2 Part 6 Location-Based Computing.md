- One way is to create a range of services based on the location ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzefxpfys60vwjsfdm2j8t4n))
- technique known as geofencing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzefy4fnyg8z8v40wp3exndn))
- A geofence is a notional (virtual) geographical boundary ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzefyjqrsvef4w7v7crhfzj8))
- to define an area within which particular services may be offered ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzefyvcn4acdzxxdt4ctc2pe))

- monitor the behaviour of offenders wearing GPS-enabled tags ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzeg9f120sdytq3tyy99htj7))
#### 6.1.2 Linking location and context
- A single piece of location information on its own may appear to have little value ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzegea5c3ksebgk5e1rjka0b))
- when collected over time or combined ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzegegnkghdw5ftn49pap4ac))
- its true value may become more apparent ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzegenpd4eq1mbq753v54fv1))
- Used on its own, location is quite a crude indicator ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzegmwdemevxzg10hbvyr4br))
- the existence of other data that can be combined with the location data ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzegn5tc0kzfnjzkxez9kps9))
- it is often possible to use a series of time-stamped location readings to make better estimates of the user’s current activity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzegq910x0s2d2xafwzqbh5m))
- such technologies might be used to give parents peace of mind about where their children are. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzegsnevev27076mb2h37rpt))
- allow photos to be tagged with information about who is in the photograph as well as geotagged ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzegtkrf74g205gnw2wj3vdd))
- you might not remain anonymous for long if you post even a small amount of location-revealing information ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzegw1h2v6jkfdxttqa1q477))
#### 6.1.3 Categorising location-based services
- Classification schemes, or taxonomies, provide a means for categorising related items according to various attributes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzerxz006rpnddv8tjsq0wdm))
- described in the academic paper ‘Towards a taxonomy of location-based services’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzery7ae9z2epbkq41pynf34))
- a location-based service representing data objects that are of interest ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzerz6k1aymz8z73bccr8db5))
- and a query object ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzerzgmt66jd9tzebv8dttg4))
- The classification scheme is based around whether or not either party (the query object or the data object) is stationary or moving. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzerzsayayjf81r21y4nsz3v))
- Service type ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzesbr7x4j73z6s15tdyq8xp))

- Get-together ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzesc6463f6zxh5kmgyg4ekv))
### 6.2 Introducing GPS: Where in the world are you?
- Global Positioning System (GPS) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzesdxdswhrqxdc65cy4ev6t))
- GPS is a line-of-sight technology; that is, there should be an unobstructed view of the satellites from the receiver ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzeshwzce57has9ahp8nszdv))
- As well as using GPS for individual route-finding, GPS trackers are also used by many commercial vehicle operators to privately keep track of the vehicles in their fleet ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzest6vv666sey439khmrjhc))
- real-time sources of data are also available for tracking other sorts of vehicle, and increasing amounts of this information are being made publicly available ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzestec4b2tnrd2kg5m7vb2q))
#### 6.2.1 Identifying where you are: from addresses to locations
- To pinpoint a location more exactly, we need to find a way of referring to a particular point ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzeszqtx1ddf9dgawtq62bv3))
- The page number and grid coordinates specify an on-page ‘address’ for a location in a road atlas that allow me to locate it on a particular page ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzet36bsdbayqgvrmc1vrv3j))
- but if I were to share those coordinates with you, they wouldn’t necessarily be of much use to you unless you had a copy of the same road atlas ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzet62e6rwxxgrqk7z5hw83a))
- What we really need is a globally agreed-upon coordinate system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzet6eejq1pcebx12mj4mjkc))
#### 6.2.2 Latitude and longitude
- this coordinate scheme, sometimes referred to as the latitude/longitude or ‘lat–long’ coordinate scheme, we imagine a series of lines drawn over the surface of the Earth ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzet9jdppnx0jca2t7mas05d))
- latitude are imaginary horizontal lines ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzetg31yrrkcme5p4q9329xm))
- equator is defined to be 0 degrees ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzetgdz4jm52henzvhyrxqby))
- longitude, also known as meridians, run vertically ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzetgkathcj37pbahzf6m9vn))
- grounds of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich was established as the Prime Meridian, or 0 degrees longitude ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzetgybfkdahyw35rpjns651))
- The fixed reference point or origin ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzethafydc5zg55tt6rj4ghg))
- where the equator and the Greenwich meridian cross. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzethg8cgn7214424epg7e86))
- the coordinates of a particular location are represented in terms of degrees of rotation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzetjxncj5wkny9xdhh963ky))
- The direction of rotation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzetkbmvwjtqf7yxyqkf1a0s))
- is indicated by whether the value is positive or negative ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzetkknvefe8bf7x6t1eb6vb))
- Negative longitudes indicate positions west of the Greenwich meridian ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzetkshj2sezhdsqdg36gx9q))
- Similarly, negative latitudes indicate positions south of the equator ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzetm293zrb0jkcbc10rntde))
- The latitude/longitude coordinate scheme used by GPS, as well as online maps such as Google Maps, is formally known as WGS 84 (or alternatively, EPSG:4326) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzf26gh98n1c3g7757a46qw7))
#### 6.2.3 GPS-based location detection
- Rather than responding to individual requests from each separate receiver, each satellite broadcasts the same information to all the GPS receivers that are in sight of it. It is then up to each receiver to work out where it is for itself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzf2cvfrmv6rh67wn3ccnh5m))
- based on the time taken for the signal to go from satellites (with known positions) to the receiver ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzf2gyeb148w3na039z93q8j))
- very accurate timing and the ability to use synchronised clocks on the satellites and at the receiver ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzf2rrdh1tjabmcykmr6gkg1))
- The signal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzf2tt6nbcp0brb9nkmj85ty))
- contains a sequence of code that runs continuously and synchronously ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzf2v1bj2k8kvb32dx5ye83g))
- Assuming that the code sequence runs in perfect synchrony at both the transmitter and the receiver, the GPS receiver can compare the received code with the code already running at the receiver. The received code will appear delayed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzf2vsh3yge5nvp6p8hpxhrf))
- the time it takes for the signal to travel ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzf2w82hnb3dppnqwyzj21zz))
- from a GPS satellite directly above it, at an altitude of 20 800 km ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzf2ynsq9acb3y86w9g2sxtb))
- radio signal travels at the speed of light ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzf2yv9rg670zrw949z1kcc6))
- speed = distance / time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzf2z5hsm14by4t34ktt5j2e))
- 6.2.4 Two more challenges to using GPS ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzf36gm7ndk9g4rpqac0ekps))
- how do we ensure that the clocks in the receiver and the satellites are synchronised? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzf390rn599yasbj382b5j50))
- where are the satellites, so that we can fix our position relative to them? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzf39cbh6fkhd88wj0j4r9p6))
- the clocks in GPS receivers are not sufficiently accurate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzf3a9ajga9mphxdjrrcb1p2))
- A solution to this problem lies in using a fourth satellite ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzf3addbsar7a16je74khdn6))
- the fourth measurement seldom does coincide, which indicates that a correction is required to the receiver’s sense of time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzfb39q5dkxdxh85e18hd07f))
- The receiver does this by searching for one single correction that it can make to all four of its timing measurements such that the fourth satellite measurement gives the same position as the other three ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzfb4tpg2ape08ve9gkzm81a))
- we now need to address the second problem: where are the satellites? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzfbd4j11nb87qqhjw1yvkg5))
- satellites is used to transmit some data, known as ephemeris data ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzfbdg4ca58y79sg8jqrqjt2))
- describes the orbit of that particular satellite ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzfbds517hxh5vbx5x3ywpz9))
- More general almanac data, which is also broadcast by the satellites, tells the receiver roughly where each satellite ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzfbes4nma433nq9ee5rtct1))
### 6.3 Where’s my phone?
- how locations can be identified using mobile phone cell towers, rather than GPS satellites ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj2qvn6a1ywac9ter9jzexf))
- cell-tower localisation may reveal the location of the receiver back to the network ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj2s8pgcpx86rmqd7c7yd2s))
#### 6.3.1 Localisation using triangulation and trilateration
- it is also possible for networks to become aware of your location based on the physical location from where you connect to the network ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj2tx6gzfpz7xzw0jh4msj0))
- Draw lines to nearby peaks on the corresponding measured bearing to each one ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj31raamfp22he828vbzqe2))
- This technique is known as triangulation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj329wv335crhj5ky81m3g7))
- if we are trying to identify our location based on just our distance from multiple cell towers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj32yjgzv5hnkmtgg34rp7w))
- we need a slightly different technique called trilateration. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj3320g0qfbtefrms2pc8p7))
- the heart of cell-tower localisation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj3s2g663d755sjy6g4vzj0))
#### 6.3.2 Approximate location determination
- we can use the location of the cell tower closest to a mobile device to approximate the device’s location ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj3tnvf56wq7n9vh0efhhx2))
- UK is also partitioned into mobile phone cell areas ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj3v1v0jps77bfkm1y70kqk))
- Each base station ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj3wh2y5xb6fcebnzsj6n3e))
- has a unique identifier, the Cell ID ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj3wkqqh6j4mrm6wnmsr6kq))
- included in every transmission ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj3z37dycjn01qj93zhvn86))
- Each Cell ID is geocoded with a latitude and longitude ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj3zsc1hs1pq52zyamgbmq0))
- The device then has an estimate of its location based upon the location of the cell tower ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj40adsrc17605v1hdgdgke))
- The accuracy of the computed location is inversely related to the transmission range of the base stations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj4jha85mw4rsdrskhhaqf8))
- This makes this technique quite effective – at least for determining an approximate location – in urban areas ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj4k75r2ftkvw4ztttsyzy8))
- improve the accuracy of location measurements, particularly in cities where tall buildings ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj4kvjn1xf3sjdx1areqe0x))
#### 6.3.3 Identifying cell tower locations
- Cell tower localisation is more frequently based on locating a device relative to multiple cell towers based on the relative signal strength detected from each of them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj4s9mn6dbq3cf3v33tx76e))
#### 6.3.4 Who knows where you are? An ongoing privacy battle
- As your phone connects to different cell towers, the cell towers may record connection information ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj50055fssm298hd9zbx6zp))
- likely to include an identifier for the phone ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj505xvyyhmngpmrbntgfe9))
- signal strength and the round-trip time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj50tbgxgnfwmy7wzvcx5xt))
- which antenna a connection was made through. (Cell towers often have antennas with a 120-degree field of view ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj51g4fx71jndvt37gd1pjj))
- is very powerful. But it also provides a cautionary tale. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj54e40gjevvjd4jbr2c9bt))
- The legislation was written by governments such that it *obliged* communications providers to retain such information ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj5ykkq2xp9jde0vn9mxzh5))
- access to it could then be requested as part of a criminal investigation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzj5yw2frs284yba4p2v5549))
### 6.4 I’m home… Wi-Fi reveals location too
- your web browser occasionally prompts you for location information ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzmmhvp2103xvazv1xx6dtz5))
#### 6.4.1 Wi-Fi-hotspot-based localisation
- Computing devices can also use Wi-Fi connection points to estimate location in a related way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzmmqbvc0tnzb5ketzyvky0q))
- each Wi-Fi router also has a unique identifier associated with it in the form of a MAC address ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzmmqm5ktfa0q8k8kj10jb4e))
- global databases exist that have locatio ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzmn0x4cdgv2fen2tmk0nx43))
- global databases exist that have location information associated with Wi-Fi router MAC addresses ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzmn1jycwz3tcbw2r9xwdxsv))
- the location information may not be reliable – for example, if the router has been moved ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzmn2n1ctx8gsbp168am2s3n))
- If you also know the power of the signal from the router, and an estimate of the signal power associated with it, you can use that information to improve your estimate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp7jvtt4spt92xbsaa06g03))
#### 6.4.2 Tracking devices using Wi-Fi
- two ways in which Wi-Fi enabled devices can identify any nearby access points ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp7nec07cq5rba284z4r6gf))
- passive mode ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp7njv7dm0z856pnw07krnr))
- beacon signal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp7p43pc0rj2mmdpwh9kx9b))
- active mode ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp7nnbxjwbnhnst1f6qtqg2))
- broadcast message includes the device MAC address ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp7qe6nbee2p96xpqtygpjq))
- passive-mode approach is that it may be expensive in terms of battery usage ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp7sxdgfyxyq1vnfhk0c305))
- lower-power active mode is thus the often preferred option, at least in terms of maximising battery life ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp7t5c2wcx3x785tcs3vq4g))
- the owner of the Wi-Fi router may be able to inspect the connection records ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp817hhh4d2c2vc2n6r3azh))
- the scanner mode ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp81r3tb0mz7dr9pvfkj1eb))
- device to capture Wi-Fi traffic passing over a particular Wi-Fi channel ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp85a3gbfn7h8vfbp8e560c))
- og of the MAC addresses of devices using that channel ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp85jqx4n31g2vyfdjbg6pm))
- by making a browser location request – your request, and location, may be logged ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp8675e1vhzcjzv7rr5yq2a))
#### 6.4.3 Geocoding and reverse-geocoding
- service that allows online mapping systems to take an address and resolve it to a latitude and longitude ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp8c6313z1szm50fs2yft8a))
- is known as a geocoding service, or geocoder. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp8ca39k0hvydsr6r7xbspx))
#### 6.4.4 Accessing geocoding APIs programmatically
- Another class of addresses that can be geocoded are IP addresses ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp8gtnmjkxt6svfn23pzjs2))
- may not be meaningful ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp8h80rfa05c45r1xwhvhdp))
- may be presented with the location of your internet service provider’s (ISP’s) servers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp8hdds570qfafv4k9a42tp))
- the country associated with your IP address should be the country ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp8np8naex7fhxjprpfrjnh))
- access to services is either allowed or disallowed based on location ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzp8p55pvkbt0kwbagt534js))
#### 6.4.5 Displaying locations on maps
- look at the distribution ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpezvrh7z9r7rd8y41a1prm))
### 6.5 Indoor tracking: Just the place for Bluetooth beacons
- designed primarily to alert a passing device that it is in a particular location ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpf2xk1hzrv9b1t4gfdfgn1))
#### 6.5.1 Passing trade: Bluetooth beacons and contextual alerts
- fixed Bluetooth beacons are installed in particular locations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpf7w7dya629jrdsv3b4ybg))
- identifying code of each beacon is registered in a directory, along with its location ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpf87j7frr6yznzb55ppbew))
- looking up the location ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpf8kb3cbdwy4y2bh8hd2qf))
- app which uses Bluetooth to listen out for the presence of a nearby beacon ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpf9bzyjbk33rkch2x9w3n9))
- may also be used to support navigation for users with limited vision ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpfavwdedk8ae9qzwd37qzf))
#### 6.5.2 Localisation using Bluetooth beacons
- the beacon identifier is transmitted along with a benchmarked power value ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpfke4n11zgmdmcanre30ax))
- we can use the power of the signal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpfkqsz3bbcf5r6w67dtwh2))
- to calculate the distance the receiver is from the transmitter ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpfkxjpsjnnta1nde5b92b1))
- Suppose instead that there are three beacons in range ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpfp5gxxzqpfpnb6ez7968y))
- Knowing the location of the three beacons, and the distance to each of them, allows us to locate the receiver. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpfp893rbeq013bh76f2kaj))
- draw circles with corresponding radii around each beacon, we can look to see where the circles intersect ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpfr65fa3hre84s386xxv4z))
- In the real world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpfsh8qvbs86trntav0fwmr))
- there is likely to be an element of error or uncertainty ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpfsp9wetfpebjs0jt63p6g))
- The rings intersect over an area, rather than a point ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpfszpztdhtwrh5f1rk38pk))
- The size of the intersection area represents the degree of uncertainty ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpft87721jybckr8nk3cgqx))
#### 6.5.3 Using beacons for tracking purposes
- Bluetooth LE can also be used as part of a distributed tracking system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpg6ysgtrch45x2byech3mf))
- attach a small Bluetooth LE tag to an object, essentially turning it into a mobile ad hoc beacon ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpg78asamtjqh72x4gdqah4))
#### 6.5.4 Is location data personal data?
- In many respects, our location is now just another piece of real-time data ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpgadxwh6vdhxq192dtv3jh))
- As such, location data now represents another significant set of personal data collected about us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpgazs4sr1yffyfz0tmj1x1))
- Security breaches ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpgj3qe6hd2szq9xtxhwnsd))
- you may be associated with them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpgjcmm1mt07smkz6ksay6g))
- discrimination ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzpgjv92mdk18tj4d7wxeg75))
#### 6.5.5 Who knows where you are?
