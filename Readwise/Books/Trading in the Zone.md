## Highlights
- we may want the freedom to make choices, but that doesn’t mean we are ready and willing to accept the responsibility for the outcomes. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=552))
- no matter what the outcome, you are completely responsible. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=556))
- stepping into a future projection of yourself. ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=627))
- You must create a new version of yourself, just as a sculptor creates a likeness of a model. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=628))
- are your willingness and desire to learn, fueled by your passion to be successful. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=631))
- The medium ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=634))
- I define a positive winning attitude as expecting a positive result from your efforts, with an acceptance that whatever results you get are a ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=677))
- perfect reflection of your level of development and what you need to learn to do better. ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=678))
- need lots of skills; you just need a genuine winning attitude. ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=700))
- he hasn’t experienced any pain from his trading activities to make him afraid. ([Location 704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=704))
- Do you feel responsible for fulfilling some other trader’s expectations, hopes, dreams, and desires? ([Location 786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=786))
- he shifted from a positive to a negative attitude. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=889))
- He’s no longer focused on just winning, but rather on how he can avoid pain by preventing the market from hurting him again. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=889))
- Remember our definition of a winning attitude: a positive expectation of your efforts with an acceptance that whatever results you get are a perfect reflection of your level of development and what you need to learn to do better. ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=985))
- The best traders stay in the flow because they don’t try to get anything from the market; they simply make themselves available so they can take advantage of whatever the market is offering at any given moment. There’s a huge difference between the two perspectives. ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=1053))
- Learn to accept the risk. ([Location 1074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=1074))
- Accepting the risk means accepting the consequences of your trades without emotional discomfort or fear. ([Location 1079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=1079))
- But being aware of something doesn’t automatically make it a functional part of who you are. ([Location 1163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=1163))
- It’s really a matter of willingness. ([Location 1173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=1173))
- Let’s set up a scenario, where your last two or three trades were losers. You are watching the market, and the variables you use to indicate that an opportunity exists are now present. Instead ([Location 1451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=1451))
- of immediately executing the trade, you hesitate. The trade feels very risky, so risky, in fact, that you start questioning whether this is “really” a signal. ([Location 1453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=1453))
- trade without fear or overconfidence, 2) perceive what the market is offering from its perspective, 3) stay completely focused in the “now moment opportunity flow,” and 4) spontaneously enter the “zone,” ([Location 1505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=1505))
- The essence of what it means to be in “the zone” is that your mind and the market are in sync. ([Location 1535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=1535))
- There’s nothing to stop the price of an issue from going as high or low as whatever some trader in the world believes is possible—if, ([Location 1623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=1623))
- He would be absolutely certain that certainty doesn’t exist. ([Location 1864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=1864))
- “I know who’s in this market and who’s about to come into this market. I know what they believe about what is high or what is low. Furthermore, I know each individual’s capacity to act on those beliefs (the degree of clarity or relative lack of inner conflict), and with this knowledge, I am able to determine how the actions of each of these individuals will affect price movement in its collective form a second, a minute, an hour, a day, or a week from now.” ([Location 1891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=1891))
- flipping a coin, calling heads, and seeing the coin come up tails. ([Location 1901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=1901))
- nothing else has the potential to create more unhappiness and emotional misery than an unfulfilled expectation. ([Location 1918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=1918))
- But the pattern loses its significance (becomes invisible) because we find it too painful to acknowledge. ([Location 1944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=1944))
- If it’s not coming from the market, then it has to be coming from the way we define and interpret the available information. ([Location 2005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=2005))
- We have to be rigid in our rules and flexible in our expectations. We need to be rigid in our rules so that we gain a sense of self-trust that can, and will always, protect us in an environment that has few, if any, boundaries. We need to be flexible in our expectations so we can perceive, with the greatest degree of clarity and objectivity, what the market is communicating to us from its perspective. ([Location 2025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=2025))
- 1. Anything can happen. ([Location 2037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=2037))
- 2. You don’t need to know what is going to happen next in order to make money. 3. There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge. 4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another. 5. Every moment in the market is unique. ([Location 2038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=2038))
- If you flipped a coin and guessed right, you wouldn’t necessarily expect to be right on the next flip simply because you were right on the last. Nor would you expect to be wrong on the next flip if you were wrong on the last. ([Location 2065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=2065))
- losses are simply the cost of doing business or the amount of money I need to spend to make myself available for the winning trades. ([Location 2091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=2091))
- Making yourself available means trading from the perspective that you have nothing to prove. You aren’t trying to win or to avoid losing. You aren’t trying get your money back or to take revenge on the market. ([Location 2168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=2168))
- 1. the odds are in your favor before you put on a trade; 2. how much it’s going to cost to find out if the trade is going to work; 3. you don’t need to know what’s going to happen next to make money on that trade; and 4. anything can happen; ([Location 2194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=2194))
- I AM A CONSISTENT WINNER BECAUSE: 1. I objectively identify my edges. 2. I predefine the risk of every trade. 3. I completely accept the risk or I am willing to let go of the trade. 4. I act on my edges without reservation or hesitation. 5. I pay myself as the market makes money available to me. 6. I continually monitor my susceptibility for making errors. ([Location 2999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=2999))
- 7. I understand the absolute necessity of these principles of consistent success and, therefore, I never violate them. ([Location 3005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=3005))
- 1. you have an edge that genuinely puts the odds of success in your favor; 2. you can think about trading in the appropriate manner (the five fundamental truths); and 3. you can do everything you need to do over a series of trades. ([Location 3070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=3070))
- Pick a market. ([Location 3075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=3075))
- Choose a set of market variables that define an edge. ([Location 3077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=3077))
- The trading system or methodology you choose can be mathematical, mechanical, or visual (based on patterns in price charts). ([Location 3078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=3078))
- Trade Entry. The variables you use to define your edge have to be absolutely precise. The system has to be designed so that it does not require you to make any subjective decisions or judgments about whether your edge is present. If the market is aligned in a way that conforms with the rigid variables of your system, then you have a trade; if not, then you don’t have a trade. ([Location 3090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=3090))
- Time Frame. Your trading methodology can be in any time frame that suits you, but all your entry and exit signals have to be based in the same time frame. ([Location 3099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=3099))
- you could have as a filter a rule that states you’re only going to take trades that are in the direction of the major trend. ([Location 3103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=3103))
- Taking Profits. ([Location 3120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=3120))
- Trading in Sample Sizes. ([Location 3181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=3181))
- size of 20 trades or more. ([Location 3185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H1TBCG&location=3185))
