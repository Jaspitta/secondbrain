- Category: #books
- Summary: The text discusses different problem types and patterns for working with lists, such as counting and finding the best value. It also covers algorithms for tasks like finding the lowest temperature and computing the sum of a list. The emphasis is on breaking down problems, recognizing patterns, and combining algorithms to solve larger computational tasks.

## Highlights
### Introduction
- we go from problems to programs via patterns and algorithms ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwvxxtaz2agxj8cam0d9cphm))
### 2.1 Generate a list
- two ways ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwvy99jggfmsrztazydkdtr7))
- generates a sequence and stores ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwvy9ffzpqjvk0ztkpcxf807))
- transforms an existing list into a new ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwvy9myqfnd0ky11v937h9ta))
#### 2.1.1 Sequences and lists
- Lists are written as comma-separated items (also called the elements of the list) within square brackets ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwvz20aahabz701t7w8es5dt))
- The length of a list is its number of elements ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwvz375j71j5jwwvxextbg15))
- the positions (also called indexes) of items start from 0, not 1 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwvz3jeda8rmsvv5f2tf8apj))
- `range(start, end)` generates all numbers from `start` up to `end` − 1. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwvz6ww4g7az6f5e46swn5vs))
- can be used to go through all the positions in a list with *n* items ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwvzbxmkn5qaamt4jm72ss4f))
- for position in range(0, len(temperatures)): ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwvzc9fzvt0172xb6y15bqk1))
#### 2.1.2 Append
- By appending each value, the list will store the values in the same order as they were generated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hwvznp70xrsm3v2vpwerd2sb))
