## Highlights
### Introduction
- We might say that advances in digital technologies change the way we live but, as you will see in Section 6.1.4, we need to be careful when talking about how technological developments ‘cause’ societal changes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr43b6pg8qn6rhgwbrzhsdct))
- People talk about ‘the death of distance’ and say that ‘geography is history’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr43cmdftxazaxn2d8gmz2xf))
- how the relationship between the state and its citizens is different ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr43exptsspttsca12z1ebmj))
- how we prove our identity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr43f8na2hdtx618hdj77jkn))
- use of biometric data ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr43fpge2ahfvz6nfhmq067n))
### 6.1 Government, the state and society
- citizens need information and resources from the state, and the state requires information from its citizens ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr43hkwyev7vg1wkedn0xd7g))
- information and communication technologies (ICTs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr43n233261ksdqc2r7e4jqz))
- improve services provided by the state and at the same time save money ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr43mwfk7cppmz6cmsgatxb6))
- is not necessarily straightforward to determine if services are ‘better’ – and if they are better, is that for everyone or just for those with access to the appropriate technology? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr43ntkm6qkmm5qq06barx7b))
- claimed, for example, that ICTs can improve democracy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr43r8b7nsnqnzw0zzs3c1sg))
- argued that the ease of international communication ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr43qjp6h4721rp0441nkkmt))
- shifting power to transnational organisations which are not beholden to any one country ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr43r0awx84y7kb7ev4d0ct3))
#### 6.1.1 Government services
- governments have claimed significant savings from moving online. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr441yp1x4d4057dztkaqbsf))
- policies to deliver digitally as much of their business as possible. The UK has used the tagline ‘digital by default ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr442x1ka3afnmwawm8jnyz7))
- you may also have experience of services which seem to be more difficult online. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr445836cgsfhe8nwte7cc86))
- UK government issued a Service Manual intended to help teams build ‘great’ public services ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr44ahbk5ynv4zqkreqhfkd1))
- Some things still cannot be done entirely online ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr44jzndw6n2zdwxhfps3hef))
- UK passport for the first time, you can use the online form but need to send in some original documents ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr44k6p148gbb8katf025kd4))
- the application fee is lower ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr44kgc84rtegmgqvzndy76b))
##### Signatures and digital signatures
- two important functions: authentication and non-repudiation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr44sv04yy32sm7d6dw1wakg))
- Authentication ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr44t5h1srjga7k2wde2an8b))
- means determining whether a document actually originates from the person it purports to come from ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr44th73bqqencx3fekvczp3))
- non-repudiation means that the person who signed the document cannot later deny ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr44tq35he028v7ne24hjz5m))
- Both functions can be performed electronically using the techniques of encryption ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr44v4b3zjfhqz5trtavy30d))
- they differ from conventional signatures in one important way: conventional signatures are an example of **biometric data**, whereas digital signatures are not. A digital signature is based upon information (a password or PIN) that you keep secret ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4558gf5ynga4ywvtjgbqhb))
#### 6.1.2 Government data
- Governments have always held data about their citizens ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr45b1a3caxa9ykv828j895n))
- need data in order to be able to collect taxes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr45b79yj505j08rr0k2d36z))
- easier to collect, store and manipulate data ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr45bh0ktysfmnehf9f1jce0))
- since the state exists for the citizens (at least in principle), there is an argument that state-owned data is ‘really’ owned by the people and should therefore be freely available to everyone ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr45c6zd26w6npyeqqz3qvbw))
- in 2009 the UK government set out its commitments on access to public data in a report entitled *Smarter Government* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr45d97vv5vyphr9bp6h0701))
- Public data’ are ‘government-held non-personal data that are collected or generated in the course of public service delivery’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr45eex94xa1htzm8pcfpbkg))
- data is not only held by governments; commercial organisations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr54cnj5t6gdbk7cz1nps5ds))
- concerns about the ethics of gathering and using personal data, such as who has access to it, what it may be used for and how securely it is held ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr54dcdfmfccswg5bt4nq72q))
#### 6.1.3 Digital democracy
- the web is that it allows citizens more involvement with government ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr54knc6wgt31kdkadjzmqzs))
- in terms of staying informed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr54kse54xafy1tk6sh31mc3))
- in terms of more actively contributing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr54kya850m85etk30zmr3dq))
- easier to find out who our elected representatives are ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr54mgh21815q2cjxs6h4em0))
- get in contact ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr54mkjtwmm866dbp1d4vd17))
- emailing your MP or national/local representative ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr54mt3ydcrs2nk198hpd6p4))
- parliamentary petitions website. Any petition gathering more than 10 000 signatures will be responded to by the government. Furthermore, for all petitions that reach 100 000 signatures, the Petitions Committee will consider whether to schedule debates or whether relevant debates are already scheduled. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr54nbx3g46ekdees3msaae6))
##### Box 6.1 Central and local government
- government can be thought of as having a central component and a local or regional component ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr552rth5r9pd1zq3w96pv80))
- Central government is generally concerned with such things as making laws ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr556g83dwzw8r8xqx52m2t6))
- taxes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr556jvfthrspy8yyecb8smz))
- armed services ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr556pys6je20st47vf7cbmk))
- transport ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr556tqxqq8pnk9qvgrvx15j))
- Local government, on the other hand, is concerned with running local services ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr557djqcbade05c13db25b1))
- Public data will be available and easy to find through a single, easy-to-use, online access point ([www.data.gov.uk](http://www.data.gov.uk)) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr4gw0gdhgv20rtdgfzdy4zp))
- schools, health centres, public libraries, refuse collection, planning permission for buildings, etc ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr557hv51bkdmwwm7yezh6vf))
#### 6.1.4 [[Technological determinism]]
- be careful of language that talks of technological developments *causing* societal changes. The concern is about what sociologists call [[Technological determinism]]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr55jhexvf5byyb966rm612b))
- [[Technological determinism]] is the idea that developments in technology are responsible for the way society develops ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5bgkp259w1qf6frfp9qz0x))
- technology *determines* social change ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5bgts1cg3ewe7m32vjyams))
- need to be cautious. It is not that developments in technology don’t have an impact on the nature of society ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5bq1s8zym4eqcgfa0z0nsh))
- But some of the discussion around technology makes it sound as if technology develops without influence from society ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5bqk2eft279e4y19qtgm9h))
- Frank Webster, an eminent sociologist ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5bv78tqp16bqw4h0b8442e))
- [[Technological determinism]]] carries two especially dubious implications: one, that technologies are the decisive agents of social change; two, that technologies are themselves aloof from the social world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5bvwz330c9dqbmrg1w209t))
- [[Technological determinism]] can be a difficult concept to get your head around when you first meet it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5bx9g7btfqvw33z6f7mvvx))
- thinking about technology in these terms helps you to understand technology and its role in society ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5bz17dswsy893eywzmc3ae))
##### Implicit [[Technological determinism]]
- is quite common for people to imply [[Technological determinism]] in the way they talk about technology, without making it explicit ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5c0g6zj32sgmczhy4s71fk))
- [[Technological determinism]] is often an inexplicit, taken-for-granted assumption which is assumed to be ‘self-evident’. Persuasive writers can make it seem like ‘natural’ common sense ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5c0ypwkz5nswva1mgeamha))
- can usually be easily spotted in frequent references to the ‘impact’ of technological ‘revolutions’ which ‘led to’ or ‘brought about’, ‘inevitable’, ‘far-reaching’, ‘effects’, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5c4xnaek5edcykd1n15dtd))
- This sort of language gives such writing an animated, visionary, prophetic tone which many people find inspiring and convincing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5c5dxvhyx44wraq7kdggxa))
- Technologically deterministic language is frequently used to in order to promote projects and initiatives, either by governments or private organisations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5cb1mzmp1qt36yzq0pftvm))
- for example, ‘Smart Cities’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5ce47f34y68z12pes2qsjy))
- Smart cities will not only create better services for citizens but also big export opportunities for UK businesses. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5cesckk9kbpehq0w0naqcm))
- Africa’s cities are well-positioned to rapidly transform ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5cfbqp60gx0bkrht21k8sk))
- tools enable cities to improve the access, reliability and resilience of its resources and spaces ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr5cg7wn3ec0xmyr9cza1grq))

#### 6.2.1 Identification and verification
- proving that a document such as a driving licence or a passport is mine, it allows me to do things but it also allows other people to identify me ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr76wqbfmd9ph8sanmdhdmtw))
- distinguish between verification and identification ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr76x8pwttwcfy8mpfz44fbt))
- If I hand my driving licence to the police and they compare the photograph with the person they see in front of them, they are confirming that the photograph is a picture of me. That is verification ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr76xsc2365h01634sqm2jdt))
- If, knowing that a car with a particular registration number (number plate) has been involved in an offence, the police search the vehicle licence (DVLA) database for that number, they are trying to identify the registered keeper. That is identification. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr76y6wa9x24aka1n067fep6))
- consider the use of a signature ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr777w551svghzjbkd0b37mf))
- for authentication ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr778gpeytbpc13bt4bsecx0))
- the person doing the checking verifies that the signature on the document matches some reference signature ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr778r16bv8zqdec4smrnwjq))
- you may see other texts that use these terms in slightly different ways ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr779p306fx63d6m9dm9cbc9))
- authentication’ is generally used in the context of digital signatures, even though verification may be involved ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr77asvd9w3jp9s5d4d5nmqp))
- A photograph is an example of biometric data ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr77bc9me122t40423an4v0r))

- might be at some centralised resource, such as, in England, the non-emergency National Health Service (NHS) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr98xd8vs163qm6p6zkm4t57))
- Most of the use of a phone is for personalised, one-to-one communication rather than broadcast ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr98v2fsszc4cabapne0pbm7))
- On the web and social media ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr9913ntg0z99qktzb1jkjh6))

#### 6.3.3 Health records
- Anyone caring for the health of someone else needs access to information about the person ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hraak04bydjkdc2cvnggdxwz))
- doctor’s surgery would have held this kind of information in a paper file ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hraaqmbmvh7bys0v0xecm31a))
- replaced by an electronic health record (EHR) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hraaqrk8cp0c72mxemkmebwm))
- There are many circumstances in which it would be beneficial to share health records ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hraf8pc585kbzaczk32f1am4))
- but because of the different systems this has often not been possible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hraf90epcv6xdfg8nd7ygfb3))
