## Highlights
- “Not me,” you think. “No one would ever call me an egomaniac.” Perhaps you’ve always thought of yourself as a pretty balanced person. But for people with ambitions, talents, drives, and potential to fulfill, ego comes with the territory. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=181))
- The need to be better than, more than, recognized for, far past any reasonable utility—that’s ego. ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=189))

- The pioneering CEO Harold Geneen compared egoism to alcoholism: “The egotist does not stumble about, knocking things off his desk. He does not stammer or drool. No, instead, he becomes more and more arrogant, and some people, not knowing what is underneath such an attitude, mistake his arrogance for a sense of power and self-confidence.” ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=204))
- Your ego is not some power you’re forced to satiate at every turn. It can be managed. It can be directed. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=248))
- One must ask: if your belief in yourself is not dependent on actual achievement, then what is it dependent on? The answer, too often when we are just setting out, is nothing. Ego. And this is why we so often see precipitous rises followed by calamitous falls. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=347))
- Yes, you, with all your talent and promise as a boy wonder or a girl-who’s-going-places. We take it for granted that you have promise. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=355))
- “Talent is only the starting point.” The question is: Will you be able to make the most of it? Or will you be your own worst enemy? Will you snuff out the flame that is just getting going? ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=358))
- One might say that the ability to evaluate one’s own ability is the most important skill of all. Without it, improvement is impossible. And certainly ego makes it difficult every step of the way. It is certainly more pleasurable to focus on our talents and strengths, but where does that get us? Arrogance and self-absorption inhibit growth. So does fantasy and “vision.” ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=364))
- In this phase, you 
- think big, we must act and live small in order to accomplish what we seek. Because we will be action and education focused, and forgo validation and status, our ambition will not be grandiose but iterative—one foot in front of the other, learning and growing and putting in the time. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=371))
- It’s a temptation that exists for everyone—for talk and hype to replace action. The empty text box: “What’s on your mind?” Facebook asks. “Compose a new tweet,” Twitter beckons. Tumblr. LinkedIn. Our inbox, our iPhones, the comments section on the bottom of the article you just read. Blank spaces, begging to be filled ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=395))
- Look how great I am.” It’s rarely the truth: “I’m scared. I’m struggling. I don’t know.” ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=401))
- In other words, she did what a lot of us do when we’re scared or overwhelmed by a project: she did everything but focus on it. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=411))
- In fact, many valuable endeavors we undertake are painfully difficult, whether it’s coding a new startup or mastering a craft. But talking, talking is always easy. ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=416))
- silence is strength—particularly early on in any journey. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=419))

- Talk depletes us. Talking and doing fight for the same resources. Research shows that while goal visualization is important, after a certain point our mind begins to confuse it with actual progress. The same goes for verbalization. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=429))
- After spending so much time thinking, explaining, and talking about a task, we start to feel that we’ve gotten closer to achieving it. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=431))
- Doing great work is a struggle. It’s draining, it’s demoralizing, it’s frightening—not always, but it can feel that way when we’re deep in the middle of it. We talk to fill the void and the uncertainty. “Void,” ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=440))
- They’re too busy working to do anything else. When they do talk—it’s earned. The only relationship between work and chatter is that one kills the other. ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=451))
- he said, “you can go that way and you can do something—something for your country and for your Air Force and for yourself. If you decide you want to do something, you may not get promoted and you may not get the good assignments and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors. But you won’t have to compromise yourself. You will be true to your friends and to yourself. And your work might make a difference. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=482))
- “To be or to do? Which way will you go?” ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=487))
- Whatever we seek to do in life, reality soon intrudes on our youthful idealism. ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=488))
- How do you prevent derailment? Well, often we fall in love with an image of what success looks like. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=492))
- Having authority is not the same as being an authority. Having the right and being right are not the same either. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=496))
- Impressing people is utterly different from being truly impressive. So who are you with? Which side will you choose? This is the roll call that life puts before us. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=498))
- This is what the ego does. It crosses out what matters and replaces it with what doesn’t. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=505))
- What is your purpose? What are you here to do? Because purpose helps you answer the question “To be or to do?” ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=509))
- If your purpose is something larger than you—to accomplish something, to prove something to yourself—then suddenly everything becomes both easier and more difficult. Easier in the sense that you know now what it is you need to do and what is important to you. The other “choices” wash away, ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=517))
- Harder because each opportunity—no matter how gratifying or rewarding—must be evaluated along strict guidelines: ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=520))
- Think about this the next time you face that choice: Do I need this? Or is it really about ego? Are you ready to make the right decision? Or do the prizes still glitter off in the distance? To be or to do—life is a constant roll call. ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=532))
- The power of being a student is not just that it is an extended period of instruction, it also places the ego and ambition in someone else’s hands. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=565))
- one knows that he is not better than the “master” ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=567))
- We don’t like thinking that someone is better than us. ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=569))
- The mixed martial arts pioneer and multi-title champion Frank Shamrock has a system he trains fighters in that he calls plus, minus, and equal. Each fighter, to become great, he said, needs to have someone better that they can learn from, someone lesser who they can teach, and someone equal that they can challenge themselves against. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=576))
- The purpose of Shamrock’s formula is simple: to get real and continuous feedback ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=578))
- You put yourself beneath someone you trust.” This begins by accepting that others know more than you ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=581))
- learning. We must all become our own teachers, tutors, and critics. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=589))
- A true student is like a sponge. Absorbing what goes on around him, filtering it, latching on to what he can hold. A student is self-critical and self-motivated, always trying to improve his understanding so that he can move on to the next topic, the next challenge. ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=593))
- A real student is also his own teacher and his own critic. There is no room for ego there. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=595))
- The reality is that, though they were confident, the act of being an eternal student kept these men and women humble. ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=602))
- “It is impossible to learn that which one thinks one already knows,” ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=603))
- The art of taking feedback is such a crucial skill in life, particularly harsh and critical feedback. ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=605))
- The ego avoids such feedback at all costs, ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=607))
- Ego rushes to the end, rationalizes that patience is for losers (wrongly seeing it as a weakness), and assumes that we’re good enough to give our talents a go in the world. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=612))
- Today, books are cheaper than ever. Courses are free. Access to teachers is no longer a barrier—technology has done away with that. There is no excuse for not getting your education, and because the information we have before us is so vast, there is no excuse for ever ending that process either.

- your passion may be the very thing holding you back from power or influence or accomplishment. Because just as often, we fail with—no, because of—passion. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=631))

- Remember, “zealot” is just a nice way to say “crazy person.” ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=649))
- Opportunities are not usually deep, virgin pools that require courage and boldness to dive into, but instead are obscured, dusted over, blocked by various forms of resistance. ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=660))
- inspiration: I want to do the best and biggest ______ ever. Be the youngest ______. The only one to ______. The “firstest with the mostest.” The advice: Okay, well, here’s what you’ll need to do step-by-step to accomplish it. The reality: We hear what we want to hear. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=662))
- Because we only seem to hear about the passion of successful people, we forget that failures shared the same trait. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=666))
- imagine Napoleon was brimming with passion as he contemplated the invasion of Russia ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=671))
- Passion typically masks a weakness. Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance. You need to be able to spot this in others and in yourself, because while the origins of passion may be earnest and good, its effects are comical and then monstrous.

- If the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting different results, then passion is a form of mental retardation— ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=681))
- Dogs, god bless them, are passionate. As numerous squirrels, birds, boxes, blankets, and toys can tell you, they do not accomplish most of what they set out to do. A dog has an advantage in all this: a graciously short short-term memory that keeps at bay the creeping sense of futility and impotence. ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=683))
- Eventually it will intrude. What humans require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose, you could say, is like passion with boundaries. Realism is detachment and perspective. ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=686))
- Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself. More than purpose, we also need realism. Where do we start? What do we do first? What do we do right now? How are we sure that what we’re doing is moving us forward? What are we benchmarking ourselves against? ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=692))

- When someone gets his first job or joins a new organization, he’s often given this advice: Make other people look good and you will do well. ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=735))
- good. It’s about providing the support so that others can be good. The better wording for the advice is this: Find canvases for other people to paint on. Be an anteambulo. ([Location 739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=739))
- When you are just starting out, we can be sure of a few fundamental realities: 1) You’re not nearly as good or as important as you think you are; 2) You have an attitude that needs to be readjusted; 3) Most of what you think you know or most of what you learned in books or in school is out of date or wrong. ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=742))
- simultaneously. It’s certainly more glamorous to pursue your own glory—though hardly as effective. ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=745))
- That’s the other effect of this attitude: it reduces your ego at a critical time in your career, letting you absorb everything you can without the obstructions that block others’ vision and progress. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=746))
- In fact, making things better rather than simply looking as if you are. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=750))
- Franklin would never have been published if he’d prioritized credit over creative expression— ([Location 769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=769))

- “Say little, do much.” What we really ought to do is update and apply a version of that to our early approach. Be lesser, do more. ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AWUTMB0&location=774))
