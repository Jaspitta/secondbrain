- Summary: Smart meters are a clear example of how the Internet of Things (IoT) is used domestically. The communication technologies needed for the IoT are explored in this section, including applications in various sectors like industry, business, and home automation. Radio communication plays a crucial role in the IoT, with considerations such as range, error correction, and data rate being important factors. Different types of radio networks, from short to long-range, are discussed, highlighting the significance of licensed and unlicensed spectrum for IoT applications.

- consider the benefits of a communication-enabled electronic mousetrap ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq56e5g4r5f5kh42eh8b8xhr))
- conventional traps ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq56eqqdjafx7qvkcek29tyf))
- paying people to check the state of each trap every couple of days ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq56f0rgs2cp0abze31df378))
- electronic mousetrap, however, signalled its state (triggered or untriggered) regularly to a central office ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq56fcer6sbje3b1vxmyj84z))
- The Internet of Things (IoT) is the interconnection of sensing devices so that data can be transferred to or from devices ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq56jz0v0bqjd6tef5rmrdvx))
### 4.2 Data for the Internet of Things
#### 4.2.1 How much data?
- Internet of Things applications involve taking readings ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq56td6f8rv3rjt7135dsfvk))
- sending data from these sensors periodically to a server ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq56tp4pngsy5yz36x66hn7b))
- • How much data traffic is likely to be produced by such devices?
  • Are there special requirements for such data, such as timeliness, accuracy, security and confidentiality?
  • Can this data traffic be accommodated in existing communication networks, or are special networks required? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq56w56gmjrwr5yy3kg0jxr0))
- range of use cases ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq56xt40b5y6bakh180q3k0y))
- data amounts sent by particular devices are expected to be small ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq56y3nrhs98j82kt7s19xc3))
#### 4.2.2 Representing data digitally
- the way sensors typically represent the things they sense, and how much data might be involved. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq573s115rwysaa2h8fzhwf3))
- In general, if we use binary numbers with *n* bits, the number of different things we can represent (such as wind speed) is 2*n* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq575n8pcqz16sa09g3cg1b3))
- The number of bits in a number can be thought of as a way of quantifying information ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq57dd20c9hsdycrrnwzj5rb))
- suppose that I used the additional three binary digits in Activity 4.4 not for representing higher speeds (such as 127 km/h), but for more precision than was possible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq57m8n9g152p99k25r4y4ss))
- The numbers after the binary point indicate negative powers of 2 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq57mw4vzknhnn6e564sh1c5))
- As we move to the right, the value of each number, whether binary or denary, is halved ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq57yn8xr1zzmxggj0aamqn7))
- The process of halving continues after the point symbol, giving values of 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8, or 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq58541g8h9tb6xyrgskp1yy))
- the binary number 1111.111 represents the denary number 15.875. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq586750k9f9q96nfy2kk08g))
- more information’ might mean a ‘bigger number’ or it might mean a ‘more precise number ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq586v31eqn34g4kqezfftns))
- if each reading is a 10-bit binary number, and readings are taken every second, then the data rate could be described as 10 bits per second. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq589mv61wqsbjwq4jv6pcez))
- the binary point itself needs to be represented in some way. The usual way to handle this would be for the sender and receiver to agree ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq58cf2nynkyvnp1qt84r8ek))
- 4.2.3 Representing wind direction ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq58j56mj3n8te2em0jxvhvd))
- Another point to notice is that 0 and 1 are being used as labels, rather than for counting. We use a 0 to label one direction and a 1 for another ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq58q838prrhx7458s9j0t8w))
- This ‘labelling’ function of binary numbers is very common ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq58qnttjhss0rsk0m7z58k9))
- The labels are often arbitrary ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq58r1rkye3shkep9pnvrt0g))
- problem arises when there is no wind. The ‘bit’ of data representing wind direction will probably remain at its last reading. So part of the interpretation of the data must be that if the wind speed is zero, the label direction must be ignored, or perhaps blanked out on a display. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq58svr73vw4t33b42czwfek))
- if the wind direction is exactly easterly or westerly, a decision has to be made whether to call it northerly or southerly. As I said, this is a crude system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq58tk6q3q5bgcf35ggqv0ac))
- four wind directions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq67rvb8v2rjqrq5qesdvyyy))
- all the problems we had earlier when using only one bit to represent wind direction still exist ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq67s580178yazvpj8rhyszv))
- The representation is almost invariably an approximation. The more bits there are in the binary numbers we use, the more precise the approximation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq67tfx86h31kmx31bzt6tft))
- Binary numbers are often used for labelling, rather than for counting ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq67ttk0nsqmybjaj8zjq0cv))
- The number of bits per reading, and how often they are taken, have implications for the communication system used to convey the readings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq680gdtmgeyn50tcdzsgy1x))
- For instance, a proposed innovation in connection with ‘smart’ cities is a car sensor for every car parking space. Reporting whether the space is occupied requires only one bit, such as a 0 to indicate that the space is vacant and a 1 to indicate that it is occupied. In practice, additional data would be required – for example, to identify the parking space and to give the date and time of the reading. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq685mcnny911gypadhhbggc))
#### 4.2.4 Variable-length coding
- I have assumed that all wind-direction readings use the same number of bits. This is called fixed-length coding ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq6874wtys4dmrr4gz0xkes0))
- refers to the fixed number of bits in each label, and ‘coding’ is another term for ‘labelling’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq687g8j0z6cmz4x62a7p469))
- An alternative to fixed-length coding is variable-length coding ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq687sxn02z6186ep10pa44w))
- Variable-length coding can offer advantages over fixed-length coding if some events are much more likely than others ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq688e18pqxamewxvc209xn9))
- The receiver ‘knows’ that ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq68r193p40m2dz0rfyp0z2d))
### 4.3 Radio communication
#### 4.3.1 Problems of radio communication
- Radio is particularly susceptible to problems that do not affect communication via other media ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7rw4kbdcxwyc2192bvvcsj))
- interference from other radio devices ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7rwbfwmhexytz4gxsp7azw))
- natural processes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7rx6gcf5p5kzwb6hvy222c))
- interference increases the probability of error ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7rxstktsrm6arm65n1nzgd))
- when listening to the radio, you might occasionally hear another radio station in the background ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7rzbgaymc7d6peqj6xja6z))
- Electrical interference is often called noise ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7rzw8nk8yc0ve3358c2jre))
- Another potential problem with radio is blockage of the signal by obstacles ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7s5zbkzbfxeh8h288ygwbg))
- building ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7s6b22aqb0gp28bv8qap5q))
- wall ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7s6e9mpnyej2ywt001m7qx))
- items inside the house ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7s6hwfvddhv3qfs523ndpr))
- Metal and concrete are more obstructive to radio than wood and plaster ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7s7eq950v8drqfm2ksagqy))
- foil lining ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7s7jepgt1g2b5fhcp9btbg))
- A weakened signal is more likely to suffer from errors than a strong signal, because a weakened signal is more susceptible to interference ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7s8d7t4srzwwcqajpxmccn))
- Another potential problem with radio is reflection ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7sg3keze36pp767kecr6h9))
- the radio signal reaches its destination by two routes, with reflection along one of the routes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7sgrd260ayv48sxhjxdtzh))
- The reflected path has a different length from the direct path, and probably a different length from other reflected paths. As a result, the receiver gets two versions of the signal, but subject to different amounts of delay. This kind of self-interference is called multipath interference ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7shk4sm6d3nhcvs196e3bj))
- error correction and detection can reduce the problem of errors, but there is a price to pay for their use. Error detection and correction always increase the amount of data that has to be transmitted ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7srt4tdhn61dj917dv4kaf))
- They also increase the processing needed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7ss5vvpp2vspmk4640qtdp))
- Error correction, though, becomes ineffective if errors occur so frequently that the error correction cannot cope with them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7stwtw3a0kyp45bmpmq4ws))
- another way to reduce the error rate is to send the signal more slowly ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7svxak6tgcf8w3crtsc4ed))
- The limit of the range is therefore the point where the errors become unacceptably high at the lowest acceptable data rate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7sw5kfkf68fw4e1dga3yhc))
- in the Internet of Things a long range is often more important than a high data rate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7t81xz6e184bv8tgbxknp4))
#### 4.3.2 Licensed and unlicensed spectrum
- Another potential problem for Internet of Things applications (and all radio communication) is the limited availability of suitable radio spectrum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7tbhnsftndz52gmaktj7jq))
- The amount of the frequency band occupied is called the bandwidth. (This term is also frequently used in a different sense, to refer to a channel’s capacity for carrying data.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7tct43m8vr785espc5g92c))
- signal is unmodulated, its transmission power is confined almost entirely to the nominal frequency ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7tj9gawq6zfrxtykagb220))
- Modulation, of whatever kind, causes the signal power to be redistributed to include frequencies around the nominal frequency. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7tjd0t00d6s57fn8esrbj4))
- that there are limits to the number of radio transmissions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7txcq03pw9zdftg9xtmben))
- Multiple use of the same part of the frequency spectrum is possible if the transmitters are so far apart that the signal from one is so attenuated as to be negligible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7v1ckzxfmt13k838fb2nk7))
- divide a transmission band into channels of a standard width ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7v3fwrvbbaa4nk20cc542e))
- European television bands are divided into channels 8 MHz wide. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7v48sm1cex956a0zvbw61v))
- Because of the limited capacity of radio-frequency bands, radio transmission is highly regulated in virtually all countries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7v7jsp9mrnyhr0t824ts84))
- radio transmission usually requires a licence from ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7v7q3xm3nzsfrs8tdzycdz))
- entitles the licence holder to exclusive use of a particular channel, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7v7yr1sqbkxb7shqmyfgqp))
- Some licence holders have to pay for their licences – mobile phone operators being a prime example. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7v7cb7vpr3jymgkp57a3ja))
- Small amounts of radio spectrum, in particular bands, are reserved for unlicensed users ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7vcg5fz9wjxzdty0c129e7))
- maximum allowed transmission power. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee use unlicensed spectrum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq7vcq357kww6bgzh3aq21k7))
- maximum transmission power allowed in unlicensed spectrum is generally quite low ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8t6my5tzag0g8d1sdbqz4h))
- in Europe, the maximum transmission power allowed for Wi-Fi is 0.1 watts ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8t6tftp80q9n3f4mqqd7jb))
- Because unlicensed spectrum is open to anyone, interference levels in these bands can be high ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8t7g22pyh1ncjy6pc5x4m3))
- In relation to the Internet of Things, there is a fundamental division between systems that use licensed spectrum and those that use unlicensed spectrum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8t88yccapp9r6saerhc8ks))
#### 4.3.3 Data amount and rate
- When a sensor transmits a reading, more data has to be included than is contained in the reading itself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8tasa2q60v4qm0tmh3gx3e))
- sensor’s location ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8tdmvn5nq3pd238dym0yxr))
- date and time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8tdr9hqd1h85x3dyj292ae))
- an identifier ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8tdw2p6c6fjgd2e52shwk3))
- Error control ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8te3qdwfkpjg14frmmk44e))
- the size of sensor readings generally, which is usually in the range 80 to 1600 bits ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8td8yc3end8bjwxk66gwdr))
- Sensor readings are therefore generally in the range 10 bytes to 200 bytes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8tezefxdc3dn3qrapxdnzk))
- the internet, which uses a paired set of protocols known as TCP/IP, adds a lot of data overheads ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8tpy4wy7w7qj6wrhrqydz5))
- 1 kilobyte is a reasonable approximation to the typical size of a sensor’s data reading ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8tqfg8w3h61770rmtbphes))
- although individual Internet of Things applications might not produce much data, scaling them up to every household and business might result in a flood of data ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8ttjsds7x22g7tk4vzjyn7))
- the smallness of individual data transmissions for Internet of Things applications presents problems if the data is carried by third and fourth generations of the cellular phone system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8ty2jkhf6nnb3m9k4k65z0))
- these systems were optimised for users who would stay connected ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8ty8x89qhhw3arh7vv40qt))
- early Internet of Things applications was the new lease of life it gave to second generation (or 2G) cellular communications ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8tyn9btt2xvmftg1hqf707))
- Since 2016, adaptations to the 4G cellular system have been introduced which make it better able to accommodate Internet of Things traffic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8tywffsk15b9nbzsee1dmb))
#### 4.3.4 Sending the data
- split the range of radio transmission into short, medium and long ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8v8gnagdrh5d5va017m3ct))
- Short range would typically be a range of metres or a few tens of metres ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8v8wjkaegcgz49wccxb2g4))
- Wi-Fi is probably the most common example of short-range wireless ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8v95q8mwqtcy557wphg2kc))
- Medium range would be several tens of metres up to a few kilometres. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8v9dx0wcg6yb1q8abbf1x3))
- Long range would be from a few kilometres upwards ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8v9jk990j6ccgkfkpy1wjb))
- Short-range ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8vgy0mhj56hcap7zpa2z7t))
- for domestic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8vh1bt9xv9m512nh2kdnjn))
- ZigBee (which you met in earlier parts of this block), Wi-Fi and Bluetooth have been used ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq8vhm83t3bnvq1w8hwp13yd))
## New highlights added February 24, 2024 at 12:05 PM
- Near-field communication ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqabdgawjy8zpcrbcermptkp))
- not a form of radio transmission, although it is wireless. It is widely used for contactless payment ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqabdn99n39mk1x9qbphgmhh))
- Medium- and long-range communication ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqabgy41b564n1km2gnwekg5))
- for devices dispersed in the environment, or for mobile applications ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqabh46hxr27ytbtg1n7pkhy))
- A low-power wide area network (LPWAN) is a relatively new form of radio network envisaged solely for Internet of Things ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqabq83drnknq919t20r9e8c))
- Included in LPWANs are the modifications to 4G mentioned above to make it better able to handle small units of data ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqabqkbkxga9grvhsfex159a))
- point-to-point fixed links under ‘long range’ in Table 4.4 are generally used where installation of cable or optical fibre is not practical ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqabqyxw181z2ajvjzn1t6j9))
- a microwave dish on the island would be erected to point directly at a similar dish on the mainland ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqabtx76w9mmf5qrqf71zz58))
- point-to-point radio communication has no special role in the Internet of Things. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqabtge2jfxse541hw3fy8yg))
- Although we tend to think of radio (or wireless) communication as distinct from wired communication, in practice the two nearly always go together ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqabvnr5h0630s4gvvancbym))
- radio communication networks such as those in Table 4.4 very often function as an access network for reaching a trunk network (or core network) of wired communications ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqabwfjqke9en63gm5wgbn6m))
#### 4.3.5 Conclusion
- Radio transmission is susceptible to various kinds of interference, which cause errors in digital transmission ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqac7m8p0y2jets7r2y9bf70))
- Radio spectrum can be divided into licensed and unlicensed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqac7qdpvz4bamh1bhc0xx3f))
- Underpinning much communication is a fixed network of cables ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqac7xqtxv40mfan726vyf4k))
- data associated with particular Internet of Things applications are expected to be small, but it does not follow that Internet of Things data traffic poses no problems ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqac8cfe6rr5j3gf98cq03se))
### 4.4 Networks for the Internet of Things
#### 4.4.1 Cellular networks and Wi-Fi
- Internet of Things presents distinct networking requirements ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqacbrhw1txy1fxvwfdfk6nb))
- Untethered’ here means that there is no wire connecting the device to the network, allowing the device to be used while moving ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqace2myxk1jp4dyydf2wfv3))
- tethered connectivity, where a device has a wired data connection ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqace8xnn5kw9kfwensvrjwg))
- The problems in Activity 4.12 do not mean that broadband and Wi-Fi cannot be used for Internet of Things applications. Some applications do use those forms of communication ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqacw8pbw1bxtgdhe83sk6tg))
- An alternative to using the customers’ Wi-Fi and broadband for uploading meter readings is to use the cellular phone system, as already happens ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqad4h0xk8mxx5va6wr6kdsb))
- Cellular-based communication technology has emerged as the clear favourite for medium-range and long-range Internet of Things communication ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqad9v98rc4cmz3ecw5svrtz))
- However, as I mentioned earlier, the cellular networks that were designed especially for data services (that is, third- and fourth-generation networks, or 3G and 4G) are not well suited to Internet of Things ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqadayc7t33epcb5fypd5fw4))
#### 4.4.2 The high cost of mobile communications
- I want to explore the relatively high cost of cellular communications, and the unsuitability of recent generations of cellular communications for carrying Internet of Things data ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqadf5dphedjsr73f6mjdd24))
- High demand is met by having many close-packed short-range base stations rather than fewer long-range base stations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqadhgrkr4h7dcnzr64zkt7r))
- costs are divided into capital expenditure (or CAPEX), which are the one-off costs associated with buying ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqadjcynrh7v2hsth3rp7jzk))
- and operating expenditure (or OPEX), which is the continuing cost of running it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqadjjye0q3qrc616n7rd8tc))
- CAPEX for base stations includes the equipment and labour costs of installation, and the legal costs of permission to install ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqadkxf991qs0antysz1f6ym))
- The high density of base stations can cause the CAPEX to be high, but – at least in urban areas – such necessities as electricity and wired data connections for backhaul are usually readily available ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqadn2c6j83p1jk38kmj7e05))
- Backhaul is the term used for the link between the base station and the high-speed core network ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqadn60d0xbb5h89vf345n2t))
- In rural areas, it is often necessary to install an electricity supply and a backhaul connection to each base station. If an optical fibre or broadband link cannot be installed for backhaul, fixed point-to-point microwave links are used to connect the base station to the rest of the network ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqadpcq0ny9xsk1shdsq19bp))
- For a base station, OPEX includes the cost of the electrical power consumed and maintenance costs. The largest part of the OPEX, though, is often the rental of the site the base station is built on and the cost of conveying the backhaul traffic. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqadx9pkzp9msvkw2089zg11))
- mobile phone operators have to pay a great deal for their licensed spectrum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqadyb5h8pyn2zwa3k6y9q15))
- strong pressure on operators to maximise the financial return on their investment. Thus mobile data is much more expensive per bit of data ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqadz2ae495cdh2cf0tcp7tv))
- Fortunately for cellular operators, customers are willing to pay relatively high prices for data and services for the convenience of having access to them while on the move ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqae6d2y8n11wfx13n5jdjhd))
- The special requirements for the Internet of Things can be summarised as: cheapness, low power/long battery life, long range of transmission and reception, and small data transactions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqae752mzxb5ggf2pkcze0ga))
#### Activity 4.12 (exploratory)
- not everyone has broadband and Wi-Fi, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqacnk45cwdn1ac5g0sr8bv8))
- People might turn their Wi-Fi ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqacnwjkcr43z9bsy9yb9gqj))
- whenever the Wi-Fi password is changed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqacq3d74wseefg3sd4svvxs))
- customers could object to the energy supplier getting its data transmitted at the customers’ expense ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqacqpvag0rxjnshzdzwremt))
- Wi-Fi signals are not always usable in all parts of a building ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqacqzwk5pbvf057e70gx458))
- the possibility of false readings being sent rather than real ones ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqacrjymn4v72sm52x95t7nc))
## New highlights added February 24, 2024 at 12:57 PM

- *Long range*. Devices might be in poor locations for signal propagation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqdcytm1xf5jq7da4sw9xn64))
- need for long-range communication, although in some environments penetration might matter more ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqdczk3q1ta2ftx77q615zc6))
- fewer base stations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqdd03v4s7qdrz7sj8tdetvn))
- *Small data transactions*. The small data amounts produced by many applications present a problem for conventional mobile communications ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqdd6aj657bmvynj5wsc2tx8))
- cell which are shared dynamically among users ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqdd8y1w6w9981r2xnrgzyp1))
- process of scheduling, the amount of capacity allocated to users varies from moment to moment ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqdd97fb0t8g9ncj6w5rzwgt))
- The scheduling algorithms do not work well with users who are connected only momentarily ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqdd842t9t3j3fb8qbhkbrxx))
- led to the development of a new class of medium-and long-range cellular networks devised especially for Internet of Things applications. These are known as low-power wide area networks (LPWANs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqddn68273qg72mrq3rdw06a))
#### 4.4.3 Low-power wide area networks (LPWANs)
- designed to be cheap to install and run, to use low power/enable long battery life in devices that use the networks, to have long ranges of transmission and reception, and to be suited to small data transactions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqddsfgxhwnvmhd9b9m2gb9g))
- two types: those intended for use on licensed spectrum and those intended for use on unlicensed spectrum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqddsveey6kvvw260k87r085))
##### LPWANs for licensed spectrum
- overcome the shortcomings of the conventional cellular networks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqddv1w7180a5w8kmf023rvc))
- use much of the same infrastructure ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqddv96je13avmwwdm4xjdx0))
- NB-IoT (Narrow-Band Internet of Things) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqddw1xcg7b52rrgmf25bjjf))
- LTE Cat M1 (Long-Term Evolution – Category M1), often referred to as LTE-M (Long-Term Evolution is the official name for 4G mobile communications.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqddwd17yzdmnq49199qycjb))
- NB-IoT is designed to operate in 200-kHz-wide bands of spectrum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqde6z1hfr0gdkqh71ejt9wj))
- small amount ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqde743aqwzr5ynd5httsb79))
- Cellular operators can find such modest amounts of spectrum in, for example, the gaps between existing spectrum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqde7g8ka4fjg8cyhbmvq93h))
- 3G and 4G ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqde7v00tjsx6kdrttzqmbmv))
- 5 MHz wide and typically 20 MHz wide ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqde836vm8ah0pf8a1b90dbf))
- It used to be the case that NB-IoT would only allow communication in the uplink ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqde8ysme6gwjpzak2fzen9v))
- LTE Cat M1 is a two-way form of communication based very closely on 4G ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqdectg9zckezjmjjy7hx5bv))
- reserve a small amount of their LTE capacity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqdedhtd4g5h387baw3pr2az))
- introduces low power modes for devices and sensors by allowing them go into an idle mode ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqdee09sm45d3nsb56d0xg94))
- Prominent among these are the security and privacy features that are built into mobile cellular networks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqe4dkfdrg0stw4y1rvh76rg))
##### LPWANs for unlicensed spectrum
- are not associated with the usual cellular networks, although these new networks are themselves cellular ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqe4npn8mgs4qn337ksjj6xw))
- use of unlicensed spectrum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqe4q5cz6pgfrgywapdsegsn))
- use of very low data rates to achieve long range and penetration ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqe4q8zrs5d8bp368kbnnzs6))
- simplicity and cheapness ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqe4qbzmt27eajh8jq4exn2q))
- The grey and blue boxes are ‘gateways’, which are somewhat like base stations, for LoRaWAN networks. With the antennas shown, they can have a range of around 5 km, and with larger antennas they can have a longer range. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqe50w3qvsr88mezvy7asq1j))
- an Ethernet port is visible, which supplies both power and connectivity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqe4z0a9y29kdxwq0f2mnhxn))
- It is therefore relatively straightforward to set up city-wide coverage for this type of LPWAN. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqe50gqdqyhp77d6tgksg0yc))
- Packets are encrypted at the source, but there are few of the other sophistications associated with cellular communications ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqe52grk1cbxvv6edahazz0q))
- The maximum data rates of these LPWANs is typically very low compared with conventional cellular communication ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqe53d5kgybkahnar5z3sf7n))
- 100 bits per second ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqe53nztxvw76fvgdtb3fatb))
- a Sigfox network covers most of France with just 1200 gateways, whereas over 50 000 conventional base stations would be required ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqe545wdtw8h1pw9trnkva7v))
- use of a very narrow transmission band which concentrates the transmission power ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqe6h2402afbhkea1aemg9yp))
- it is possible that there could be a mixed economy with some markets served by an LPWAN using licensed spectrum and one or two using unlicensed spectrum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqe6htdjm1rm51v0ybsd4wb2))
- licensed spectrum could offer guaranteed delivery of data packets, high levels of security and other guarantees of a particular level of service, for which there would be a corresponding price to pay ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqe6j98cwqhyz3y98cm0vzbb))
### 4.5 Home automation
#### 4.5.1 Short-range wireless
- The Internet of Things, though, also refers to sensors and devices inside buildings which might be controlled from within the same building or from a remote location ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg4va4baebyvt1xarczmhfw))
- call this ‘home automation’, although it could include offices, for example ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg4vmyd9s2s34213kr7yrdk))
- it is expected that a program would automate various operations intelligently ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg51cgtag26rwqmhjmbw89k))
- switching on lights when it is dark outside ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg55t0smjshcfkddf80mkr3))
- Many proprietary home-automation devices do connect to the users’ Wi-Fi network, enabling both local control and off-site control. However, Wi-Fi is not always suitable for home automation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg56khk8zcdeh8b64p9m1h7))
- changing the password ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg5jbnvjs3p4r7m9gw6bbab))
- range of the Wi-Fi ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg5jj5fsfmekd3tfjh7prjb))
- power consumption ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg5jn6dm7p83b15rjzexgtv))
- led to the development of a profusion of standards for short-range, low-power, low-throughput networks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg5k2qsyzt4a2a7vadztpsg))
- ZigBee, Z-Wave, 6LoWPAN, Thread, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi HaLow, which is a current version of Wi-Fi adapted specifically for IoT applications and is ofﬁcially known as 802.11ah ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg5kpat7349jefc7dcb66vp))
- Often these standards are used in conjunction because they deal with different sorts of process ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg5m7qc84b8vcbatp52fm9e))
#### 4.5.2 Mesh networks
- use of mesh networking to get round the range problem caused by the hub-and-spoke configuration of conventional Wi-Fi (sometimes referred to as ‘infrastructure mode’ Wi-Fi) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg678d35hr1jv6x4af6wq9v))
- Device D is behind a wall and might get no signal or a very weak signal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg68y3fyp77rbb3262ajekv))
- fully interconnected mesh network, which was a type of ad hoc network in which any node could communicate directly with any other node ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg69n2fhds8z9s1ybcn06nx))
- In a partially interconnected mesh network, communication between nodes might go via intermediate nodes in a process know as **hopping** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg6db09yy36p3dg6w5h2zaq))
- any device with a message to send addresses the message to the neighbouring device that is on the route to the destination, and that device forwards it to its best placed neighbour ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg6rre55jzp3dxw1078my8c))
- similar to the way the Internet Protocol uses routing devices ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg6seqr6rj3xf0vr80pck6f))
- routes are rated on various criteria, such as number of hops, overall energy consumption or overall latency ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg6t94ez7bj1kt3131fsmc9))
- Whichever procedure is used, routing involves a certain amount of complexity, which always means power consumption and delay ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg708zzg01aj5x6msnq6nac))
- An alternative to routing is flooding. In flooding, data sent by a device reaches all nodes within range, and is retransmitted by those nodes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg70taqw639bcsef1z1td1c))
- mesh networks can cover more distance than the ‘hub-and-spoke’ configuration of conventional Wi-Fi ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg753mf3hcr66e9gwbcpc62))
- with mesh networks, the more networked devices there are in a building, the better the coverage is. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg75wkzd0qjp1df277x6gn8))
- ZigBee, Z-Wave and other domestic systems operate in a licence-free spectrum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg7dygyqxzpvwqg7tnw1q8g))
- Z-Wave uses 868.42 MHz in Europe and 908.42 MHz in the USA ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg7e8mehzmzgq9r0jf1a71q))
- Frequencies such as these, which are below 1 GHz, propagate around buildings rather better than the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg7evh282r55dsstent8ara))
- non-Wi-Fi systems such as ZigBee and Z-Wave require a separate hub or gateway from that used for Wi-Fi ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg7nscq3tfmx0dx5nn7msq5))
- nodes (or devices) designed for battery operation, it is common for nodes to go into standby ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg7wch4zn9pkdpaf798qjb6))
- waking up always takes a certain amount of time, standby mode contributes to the relatively long latency of low-energy mesh networks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqg7wqjdr2ezdgqg9xyqcvfn))
#### 4.5.3 Energy and power consumption
- I want to look at what is actually meant by ‘energy’ and ‘power’, which, scientifically speaking, are not the same. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj2k6bzn5qev993j7aavw49))
##### Work, energy and power
- In science, the terms work and energy are almost interchangeable. Both are measured in joules ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj2mynzzwrsxzxyb9b652g3))
- On Earth, approximately 10 J of *work* would be done lifting a 1 kg object through 1 metre ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj2nxxe6wcqk8rkz9vn76rf))
- by applying a force to the object ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj2pcscwt04ddetsg82bvrn))
- Work is done when a force’s point of application moves ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj2pq0gk6tqmzgpftxat9a8))
- Energy, therefore, is the capacity to do work ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj2qmz6vpgf95x5rrtsyxq9))
- it does not matter how quickly the object is raised or falls; in each case, the work, or energy, would be the same ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj2r91js24yz79d7qcftxha))
- there is clearly a difference between raising it quickly, for example in one-tenth of a second ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj2sapnbvmk3078fhqp7x48))
- What is different is the power required for the lift. A quick lift requires more power than a slow one ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj2sskmwqw5mbe6s08msfr8))
- Power is the rate at which work is done, and the unit of power is the watt (W); ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj2t7yzk0h0f75e2atg0vz5))
- 1 watt is the power required to do 1 J of work in 1 second ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj2tqfmy7s62a03k4ssed1w))
- is work ÷ time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj2v61zd6yhyn42hp0hr6rs))
- a domestic LED bulb is typically in the range of 5 W to 15 W ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj3p3ayk2ek2nhvx66wh02n))
- A continuous power consumption of 1 W by a mains-powered device would not make much difference to your electricity bill, but a small battery-powered 1 W device would typically exhaust its battery in hours or a day or two ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj3hrn7405sk2757heq9k9q))
- Individual solar panels on roofs generally can generate around 200 W depending on the strength of the sunlight ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj3j88qn9edeqsn41d8x75n))
- It would be wrong to think of the watt as being only a unit only of electrical power, although that is the context in which it is often met ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj3newb5g1dds8t12azq2s8))
#### 4.5.4 Case study: Conversations with washing machines (by Annika Wolff)
- The results of this experiment demonstrate how the Internet of Things technologies that are most useful are often those that do more than just tracking and monitoring what is happening. Instead they bring in additional data sources and use this to predict future events that help improve efficiency. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj4pgskk1rs80pb345d61rf))
- Is it more useful to know a space’s current state, or to know what it is likely to be in half an hour when you get there? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj4py2k0cb1903f9qpk5y9h))
#### 4.5.5 Conclusion
- Home automation networks are sometimes designed to use Wi-Fi, but can be subject to range problems and are not suitable if devices are battery powered ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj4r6smbgcyqp53a0mkefyt))
- Mesh networks for home automation (ZigBee, Z-Wave and others) overcome these problems, and are designed for low power consumption ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj4rgr2abkvb099jh4pep05))
- Power is the rate at which work is done. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj4rmqejkhrb6d6wxnbb3ee))
- home automation is most useful when it incorporates intelligent use of the data collected by sensors ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj4ry4btvv65pmd35fq31gs))
#### 4.6 The future?
- Much of the publicity surrounding IoT fosters an air of inevitability that this is an unstoppable technological development. The reality, however, is likely to be dictated by engineering feasibility, compromise and, most importantly, cost. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj4yjy73metxb7ms2afkd4k))
- The roll-out of 5G mobile communications and the increasing convergence of cellular networks, Wi-Fi and IoT, allied with the growth in cheap sensors and devices which can be easily deployed and run, will probably fuel consumer demand for new IoT products. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj4y918eq1swwcankwhr7ht))
- What is less clear, however, is whether this is a market that will appeal to investors and entrepreneurs who inevitably are looking for returns on their investment ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj4zbzwbk5ha0sges2bfz3r))
- The arrival of new technologies and infrastructure brings with it many new security challenges ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj4zsk82rs6zffzb4csecyr))
- Therefore appropriately robust security mechanisms need to be developed to prevent malicious activity between sensors and analysis platforms, though many IoT devices are resource-limited so will be unable to offer any authentication and encryption functionality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqj51scf4bnavy4dwqdhbzd7))
