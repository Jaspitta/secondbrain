## Highlights
- For those who want to learn more, as part of the 20-year celebration, I wrote, Why the Rich Are Getting Richer—What Is Financial Education… Really? ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=187))
- For example, one dad had a habit of saying, “I can’t afford it.” The other dad forbade those words to be used. He insisted I ask, “How can I afford it?” One is a statement, and the other is a question. One lets you off the hook, and the other forces you to think. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=241))
- One dad said, “The reason I’m not rich is because I have you kids.” The other said, “The reason I must be rich is because I have you kids.” ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=255))
- He would say things like, “I’m a rich man, and rich people don’t do this.” ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=279))
- “There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke is temporary. Poor is eternal.” ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=280))
- Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial education. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and can begin building wealth. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=315))
- The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=326))
- “You’re only poor if you give up. The most important thing is that you did something. Most people only talk and dream of getting rich. You’ve done something. I’m very proud of the two of you. I will say it again: Keep going. Don’t quit.” ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=396))
- If you can’t make up your mind decisively, then you’ll never learn to make money anyway. Opportunities come and go. Being able to know when to make quick decisions is an important skill. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=449))
- “Does teaching mean talking or a lecture?” rich dad asked. “Well, yes,” I replied. “That’s how they teach you in school,” he said, smiling. “But that is not how life teaches you, and I would say that life is the best teacher of all. Most of the time, life does not talk to you. It just sort of pushes you around. Each push is life saying, ‘Wake up. There’s something I want you to learn.’” ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=517))
- THE CONE OF LEARNING Edgar Dale gets credit for helping us to understand that we learn best through action—doing the real thing or a simulation. Sometimes it’s called experiential learning. Dale and his Cone of Learning tell us that reading and lecture are the least effective ways to learn. And yet we all know how most schools teach: reading and lecture. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=523))
- People do two things. Some just let life push them around. Others get angry and push back. But they push back against their boss, or their job, or their husband or wife. They do not know it’s life that’s pushing.” ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=530))
- “Life pushes all of us around. Some people give up and others fight. A few learn the lesson and move on. They welcome life pushing them around. To these few people, it means they need and want to learn something. They learn and move on. Most quit, and a few like you fight.” ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=533))
- LIFE AS A TEACHER Today’s millennials are learning the hard facts of life. Jobs are harder to find. Robots are replacing workers by the millions. Learning by making mistakes through trial and error is more and more important. Book learning is proving to be less valuable in the real world. No longer does a college education guarantee a job. ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=541))
- Then you die a boring old man. You’ll have lots of friends who really like you because you were such a nice hardworking guy. But the truth is that you let life push you into submission. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=547))
- So much of life is out of our control. I’ve learned to focus on what I do have control over: myself. And if things must change, first I must change. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=564))
- If you think I’m the problem, then you have to change me. If you realize that you’re the problem, then you can change yourself, learn something, and grow wiser. ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=567))
- The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=589))
- Buying or building assets that deliver cash flow is putting your money to work for you. High-paying jobs mean two things: you’re working for money and the taxes you pay will probably increase. I’ve learned to put my money to work for me and enjoy the tax benefits of generating income that doesn’t come from a paycheck. ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=594))
- When it comes to money, most people want to play it safe and feel secure. So passion does not direct them. Fear does.” ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=602))
- “But don’t you feel you should pay them more?” I asked. “I don’t have to. And besides, more money will not solve their problems. Just look at your dad. He makes a lot of money, and he still can’t pay his bills. Most people, given more money, only get into more debt.” ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=607))
- While I am a huge supporter of education and life-long learning, “going to school”—especially college—has become a financial nightmare. Student loan debt is at record highs with 44 million Americans owing nearly $1.3 trillion. Again: that’s trillion… with a T. ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=615))
- As governments expand and need more and more money, the only place to get it is the middle class. That means the workers. Every government now favors the professional investor and business owners. Workers pay tax; investors and business owners pay very little tax, if they use the tax law as intended—as a tool to build the economy. ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=652))
- Learning how to have money work for you is a lifetime study. ([Location 656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=656))
- the more I find out, the more I find out I need to know. ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=657))
- “Most people have a price. And they have a price because of human emotions named fear and greed. First, the fear of being without money motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful things money can buy. The pattern is then set.” ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=721))
- As the world population ages and more and more people move toward retirement, it’s been reported that the #1 fear is tied to money. Nearly 50% of those surveyed fear that they will outlive their money… running out of money in their “golden years.” ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=742))
- “I want you boys to avoid that trap. That is really what I want to teach you. Not just to be rich, because being rich does not solve the problem.” ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=754))
- “In fact, the reason many rich people are rich isn’t because of desire, but because of fear. They believe that money can eliminate the fear of being poor, so they amass tons of it, only to find the fear gets worse. Now they fear losing the money. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=761))
- “The avoidance of money is just as psychotic as being attached to money.” ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=768))
- If they weren’t interested in money, then why are they working? That kind of thinking is probably more psychotic than a person who hoards money.” ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=774))
- So many people say, “Oh, I’m not interested in money.” Yet they’ll work at a job for eight hours a day. ([Location 780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=780))
- Just be an observer, not a reactor, to your emotions. ([Location 784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=784))
- With the advent of derivatives and an increasingly complex economy, mastering money has become essential to surviving in the world economy. With low interest rates and an uncertain stock market, the old adages of saving and investing for the long term make no sense. ([Location 806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=806))
- In his 2016 U.S. Presidential bid, Senator Bernie Sanders stated: “Wealth and income inequality is the biggest moral crisis facing Americans today.” ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=855))
- “Learn to use your emotions to think, not think with your emotions. When you boys mastered your emotions by agreeing to work for free, I knew there was hope. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=871))
- ‘Is working harder at this the best solution to this problem?’ Most people are too afraid to rationally think things through and instead run out the door to a job they hate. ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=883))
- EMOTIONS… AND INTELLIGENCE I constantly work to control my thoughts and my emotions. I’ve seen this play out over and over in my life: When emotion goes up, intelligence goes down. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=889))
- Keep using your brain, work for free, and soon your mind will show you ways of making money far beyond what I could ever pay you. You will see things that other people never see. Most people never see these opportunities because they’re looking for money and security, so that’s all they get. The moment you see one opportunity, you’ll see them for the rest of your life. The moment you do that, I’ll teach you something else. ([Location 915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=915))
- In the Information Age and the age of the Internet, millions of people under the age of 30 are getting rich using their imaginations to create apps that change the world—from Facebook to Uber to Snapchat and others. Those with imaginations thrive while those without it are still looking for a job… a job that may soon be replaced by robots and technology. ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=942))
- Left-hemisphere moment: Despite having a high-paying job, people like Robert’s poor dad struggled to make ends meet. Right-hemisphere moment: Looking at the discarded comic books in a new, creative way led to a business opportunity. Subconscious moment: People let the emotions of fear and greed rule their lives. ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1009))
- It’s not how much money you make. It’s how much money you keep. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1058))
- Retirement does not mean not working. For us, it means that, barring unforeseen cataclysmic changes, we can work or not work, and our wealth grows automatically, staying ahead of inflation. Our assets are large enough to grow by themselves. It’s like planting a tree. You water it for years, and then one day it doesn’t need you anymore. Its roots are implanted deep enough. Then the tree provides shade for your enjoyment. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1063))
- The Richest Businessmen ([Location 1071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1071))
- I am concerned that too many people are too focused on money and not on their greatest wealth, their education. ([Location 1082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1082))
- Accounting is possibly the most confusing, boring subject in the world, but if you want to be rich long-term, it could be the most important subject. For ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1107))
- Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities that they think are assets. ([Location 1111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1111))
- You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets. ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1117))
- Rich dad believed in the KISS principle—Keep It Simple, Stupid (or Keep It Super Simple) ([Location 1135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1135))
- An asset puts money in my pocket. A liability takes money out of my pocket. ([Location 1142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1142))
- “What defines an asset are not words, but numbers. And if you can’t read the numbers, you can’t tell an asset from a hole in the ground. In accounting,” ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1144))
- “The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.” ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1150))

- Money often makes obvious our tragic human flaws, putting a spotlight on what we don’t know. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1188))
- Cash flow tells the story of how a person handles money. ([Location 1193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1193))
- That is the reason it is so hard to motivate kids in school today. They know that professional success is no longer solely linked to academic success, as it once was. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1200))
- What is missing from their education is not how to make money, but how to manage money. ([Location 1203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1203))
- The process repeats itself: Higher incomes cause higher taxes, also called “bracket creep.” A credit card comes in the mail. They use it and max it out. ([Location 1230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1230))
- Today, based on 2016 stats, U.S. consumer credit card debt is at an all-time high: $779 billion. Is it all bad debt… or good debt? Do you know the difference? ([Location 1238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1238))
- As a child, my dad often told us that the Japanese were aware of three powers: the power of the sword, the jewel, and the mirror. ([Location 1248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1248))
- A person can be highly educated, professionally successful, and financially illiterate. ([Location 1256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1256))
- The fear of being different prevents most people from seeking new ways to solve their problems. ([Location 1264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1264))
- Fear is the main reason that people say, “Play it safe.” ([Location 1266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1266))
- It is that same fear, the fear of ostracism, that causes people to conform to, and not question, commonly accepted opinions or popular trends: ([Location 1268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1268))
- Rich dad surrounded himself with men and women who were specialists: attorneys, accountants, brokers, and bankers… and Kim and I have done the same. Today, our team of Advisors is among our greatest assets. What’s more important than money? An entrepreneur’s team… Who’s on yours? ([Location 1279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1279))
- “An intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than he is.” ([Location 1288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1288))
- The greatest losses of all are those from missed opportunities. If all your money is tied up in your house, you may be forced to work harder because your money continues blowing out of the expense column, instead of adding to the asset column—the classic middle-class cash-flow pattern. If a young couple would put more money into their asset column early on, their later years would be easier. Their assets would have grown and would be available to help cover expenses. ([Location 1323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1323))
- When I want a bigger house, I first buy assets that will generate the cash flow to pay for the house. ([Location 1338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1338))
- Without a financial statement you don’t really know where you are in life’s financial game. Like it or not, money tells the score of your “game,” and a financial statement is your scorecard. Banks want financial statements—Income Statement and Balance Sheet—to know how well you’re scoring in your life’s financial game. ([Location 1341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1341))
- Since Enron, it has become clear that pension plans are in trouble. Even government pension plans, such as those in Greece, Italy, and California, cannot pay out what is owed to retirees. So a retirement plan is no longer the guarantee it once was of security for old age and retirement. When the stock market crashed in 2009, anyone about to retire was in trouble—even if they had saved in their 401(k), RRSP, or SuperAnnuation. ([Location 1367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1367))
- Today, few people have enough money to live on, for even one month. Most Americans, for example, have less than $400 in savings. A more staggering statistic reported in a 2016 GOBankingRates survey: 34% of American have no savings at all. Few people could survive for very long without a paycheck or government assistance.

- •   The rich buy assets.       •   The poor only have expenses.       •   The middle class buy liabilities they think are assets. ([Location 1436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1436))
- That doesn’t mean you can’t ever buy a bigger house. But make sure to first buy assets that will generate the cash flow to pay for the house. ([Location 1517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1517))
- The middle class get stuck in the Rat Race because they treat their home as an asset instead of investing in income-producing assets. ([Location 1520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1520))
- “Wealth is a person’s ability to survive so many number of days forward—or, if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?” ([Location 1528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1528))
- Assets put money in your pocket. If something takes money out of your pocket, it’s not an asset; it’s a liability. ([Location 1532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1532))
- “Intelligence solves problems and produces money. Money without financial intelligence is money soon gone.” ([Location 1542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1542))

- BALANCE SHEET: The lower part of an income-statement diagram, so called because it’s supposed to balance assets against liabilities. ([Location 1576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1576))
- FINANCIAL APTITUDE: What you do with the money once you make it, how to keep people from taking it from you, how to keep it longer, and how to make that money work hard for you. ([Location 1580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1580))
- INCOME STATEMENT, OR PROFIT-AND-LOSS STATEMENT: It measures income and expenses: money in and money out. ([Location 1583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1583))
- LIABILITY: Something that takes money “out of your pocket.” ([Location 1584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1584))
- MUTUAL FUND: A variety of stocks, bonds, or securities grouped together, managed by a professional investment company and purchased by individual investors through shares. The shares possess no direct ownership value in the various companies. ([Location 1585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1585))

- That secret is: Mind your own business. Financial struggle is often directly the result of people working all their lives for someone else. ([Location 1619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1619))
- They wanted to know why I did not have a normal job with a salary. They did not question the Armani suits, golf clubs, or art collection. Life is sometimes tough when you do not fit the standard profile. ([Location 1657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1657))
- Businesses that do not require my presence I own them, but they are managed or run by other people. If I have to work there, it’s not a business. It becomes my job. ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1677))
- Stocks       •   Bonds       •   Income-generating real estate       •   Notes (IOUs)       •   Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, and patents       •   Anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates, and has a ready market ([Location 1679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1679))
- Start minding your own business. Keep your daytime job, but start buying real assets, not liabilities. ([Location 1691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1691))
- With small companies, my investment strategy is to be out of the stock in a year. ([Location 1698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1698))
- On the other hand, my real estate strategy is to start small and keep trading up for bigger properties and, therefore, delay paying taxes on the gain. ([Location 1699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1699))
- Once a dollar goes into it, never let it come out. Think of it this way: Once a dollar goes into your asset column, it becomes your employee. The best thing about money is that it works 24 hours a day and can work for generations. ([Location 1709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1709))

- The reality is that the rich are not taxed. It’s the middle class, especially the educated upper-income middle class, who pays for the poor. ([Location 1834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1834))
- in England and America, there were no taxes. Occasionally, there were temporary taxes levied in order to pay for wars. ([Location 1838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1838))
- In 1874, England made income tax a permanent levy on its citizens. In 1913, an income tax became permanent in the United States ([Location 1840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1840))

- The rich will never be taxed. More and more often we see governments use the tax laws to provide incentives to business owners and investors to create jobs and housing. These incentives reduce the taxes of the rich. So the only place for the government to drive tax revenue is from the middle class. ([Location 1864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1864))
- and the “tax-the-rich” idea was adjusted to include lower-income levels, down to the very people who voted it in, the poor and the middle class. True capitalists used their financial knowledge to simply find an escape. ([Location 1889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1889))

- Every time people try to punish the rich, the rich don’t simply comply. They react. They have the money, power, and intent to change things. They don’t just sit there and voluntarily pay more taxes. ([Location 1903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=1903))
- The tax man will take as much as you let him. The tax system is ultimately fair in that it works the same for everyone who has the same situation. If you are willing to invest, the tax laws will work in your favor. If you want to just spend money and buy liabilities, the tax law won’t give you any breaks—and it’s likely you will pay the most tax possible.

- Today, as technology continues to change the way we work and do business, I talk with more and more people who ask themselves: “How can I own the ladder?” Capitalism is thriving and the free-market system means that entrepreneurs who can offer a better product at a better price have a good chance of success.

- In the 1970s, we could ‘save our way to retirement.’ Passbook savings accounts earned double-digit interest and savings accounts could actually grow our wealth. Those days are long gone.

- Most teachers lack real-world experience—they have not done what they teach. They haven’t actually experienced what they teach, made mistakes, learned from those mistakes, and applied what they’ve learned as they continue to practice and get better and better. Schools teach us to read and memorize. I believe that ‘studying’ is the key to applying what we learn. Kim and I meet with our Advisors several times a year and we choose books to read and study together. As the Cone of Learning (on page 28) illustrates, discussion and cooperation are great ways to learn. ([Location 2708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07C7M8SX9&location=2708))

- This merits repeating: The #1 fear among aging Americans is outliving their money. As many pension plans changed—to a ‘defined benefit’ versus a ‘defined contribution’ plan with a cap on total dollars available—it changed the rules for how people plan for retirement and will likely stress government assistance programs and entitlements.

- People are living longer and the cost of care is getting more and more expensive. Drug manufacturers are charging more and insurance companies are paying less. Nearly everyone is feeling the pinch. While the specifics and stats vary, most research points to the fact that a majority of bankruptcies in the U.S. are a result of out-of-control medical costs.

- Many corporations do the same thing. They find a young bright student just out of business school and begin grooming that person to someday take over the company. So these bright young employees do not specialize in one department. They are moved from department to department to learn all the aspects of business systems.

I’ve always believed that for things to change, first I must change. Today, many people are choosing to change and advocate for change… in an antiquated, obsolete system.
