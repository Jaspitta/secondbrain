### 7.2 Information assets
#### 7.2.1 What is at risk from attack?
- Cybersecurity professionals refer to valuable data as information assets ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03vaghhjk8v8px2p0x3ng5q))
#### 7.2.2 Understanding current threats
- Any discussion of protecting assets uses three key terms: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03vf6x82ehq4vzq6m95f627))
- vulnerability ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03vf98ehtp5jv0eehjnc5q7))

- we will discuss how computer scientists have attempted to make information more secure ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03vkv2q7x695vtzqkn00jbc))
### 7.3 Authentication
#### 7.3.1 Passwords
- a way of uniquely identifying each user in a way that prevents users from impersonating one another ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03vpk2dzjhaaw4xbwvzrgkr))
- identification, authentication and authorisation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03vppffhz2csj10acz9pmz0))
- Identification. *The process of claiming you are a particular individual* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03vqp3namzyt578trx51sgf))
- Authentication. *The process of proving your identification.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03vs2ghjeaae12vp8pwqm2f))
- Authorisation. *Follows the processes of identification and authentication and provides access.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03vvqhd1h9atwsvzqm1f6rx))
- identification by providing a user ID and password, authentication is performed by comparing the password you provided with a password stored on the system for the user ID you provided. If they match, authorisation takes place ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03vypacenv47wpnzwrarzkm))
#### 7.3.2 What happens when you enter a password?
- The password is *transmitted* as plaintext. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03w6z4yqfsy6ancdjgy3srx))
- The password is also *stored* as plaintext ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03w7416mkfynghe47dfn9ws))
- The first problem is overcome by encrypting communications ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03w7aa71zjenbknxhsnz7sa))
- The second problem is solved by obscuring passwords using a technique known as hashing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03w7jp071phj5fqvyknc5qh))

- nearly impossible to transform the hash back ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03wdyrfzk1k64em5f2891yr))
#### 7.3.3 Applying hashing to passwords
- Computers create a new hash of a password whenever one is created or modified. Only the hash is stored ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03wmn2h30gs91qv1rys76ca))
- The user is granted access to the computer only if the two hashes match ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j03wrvwjqe8kc68snxn1trfd))
##### Brute-force attack

#### 7.4.5 Defending against malware
##### Antivirus software
- uses several techniques to identify malware. The two most common are known as **signatures** and **heuristics** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j082zm9snx055tjnmz4d3s9s))
##### Signatures
- it can only detect malware for which a signature has been identified and published ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0834cvxnw5rbcnmcey83d4h))
- two significant drawbacks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0837z1hxy3y7rnb6p2nh06b))
- Malware authors regularly release new versions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08388ny57v332bphahcp6ge))
- These polymorphic (or metamorphic) programs have the effect of automatically producing new signatures ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0838zf0q0p5tv8wqaaahh81))
##### Heuristics
- The antivirus software will ‘decompile’ the suspicious program back to its source code and examine it for instructions typical of malware ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j083g82xk8ag0hx931cxmzkq))
- heuristics do not require specific knowledge about individual types of malware ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j083h1xxyyv7rcg8ybqwzybv))

#### 7.5.4 The Stuxnet attack
- the Natanz plant was using illegally imported Siemens PLCs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08bca2a9bvejp7kxcj3mkxe))
- unclear how Stuxnet entered the Natanz plant ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08bdvpndb01emawa8f2w6z5))

#### 7.5.5 Stuxnet's relative goes global
- discovered a second piece of malware exploiting multiple zero-day vulnerabilities ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08bmr0518evnsmez8rw90gz))
- Named Duqu ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08bmvhypchk178zztqrfwzx))
- shared a great deal of code with Stuxnet ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08bmzehnwg2kb9cgn5kay3q))
- Duqu 2.0, as it became known, proved especially adept at hiding from antivirus programs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08bqnrcpma8d3znte6y8yzr))
- if the machine was ever rebooted, all traces of infection would disappear ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08brp32apzqraem97yjkych))
- Duqu 2.0 was not intended to be destructive; instead, it was a tool for espionage ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08btfy01hkgcy0djacbpqvf))
- in February 2017 a new wave of Duqu malware rippled across the world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08j6rdkfbswf4b7hq8ra5f5))
