- Category: #books
- Summary: Wireless communications encompass a variety of technologies that allow devices to exchange information and connect to the internet. Different mobile devices and wireless networks are suitable for different tasks, with short-range communication between personal devices using Bluetooth being a common practice. Digitization and modulation are important processes in wireless transmission, converting binary bitstreams into electromagnetic waves suitable for transmission. The architecture of mobile systems, such as the GSM system, involves interconnected mobiles, cells, and base stations. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee are three technologies used for short-range wireless data transmission, each with different modes of operation and structures. Security is a significant concern in wireless networks, and the establishment of appropriate standards and regulations is essential.

## Highlights
- problems that have to be overcome are:
  1. the decrease of power in a radio signal with distance travelled
  2. how to convert a binary bitstream into a form suitable for radio transmission
  3. how to prevent interference between wireless signals being transmitted simultaneously
  4. integrating the major components of a mobile system – often known as ‘system architecture’
  5. the detection and correction of errors
  6. how to keep systems secure from accidental or deliberate damage ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpm7c2cf89yvvp8q2k4dfpc6))
- it is now possible to integrate into a single handheld device a range of functions that once required several devices ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpm7fvnhzk05zxp9m80jagbh))
- Bluetooth connection is a short-range wireless data transmission link used to connect small devices up to a few tens of metres apart ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpm7kqc1w1z5kat3wfke6rdr))
- Wi-Fi is a wireless technology which enables devices such as laptops and printers to be connected together to form a local area network (LAN), and which enables mobile devices such as laptop computers and mobile phones to connect to the internet ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpm7nbpx29ss877nv5126c3d))
- different mobile devices and wireless networks are suitable for different tasks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpm7z0dvvdy1cpdembsamw4x))
- the way an electromagnetic wave repeats can be described by its frequency, period or wavelength ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpm85ymz0hhs58jhk63ca2gd))
- Attenuation also normally depends on the frequency of the signal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnrasj7y7pq90ht6weg2c90))
- for the type of mobile systems considered in this part, attenuation brings significant benefits ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnrbzaehw5668nc6zaajcyq))
- objects, geographical features and even the earth’s atmosphere, all of which can increase the attenuation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnrem1hf04eax2cgef4r8hb))
- ![](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/reader/parsed_document_assets/141610111/_T5wC0n3VSL4iN8pI2W0ng1MEXiT4yxWZKYFYavDsEs-asse_DxlamcY.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnrgrbdrs79jqk9qcmtnepw))
- After travelling a distance of 1 unit, the power of the wave is spread over the area indicated by the curved square. At twice the distance (labelled 2 units), it is spread over four times the area, and at 3 units, it is spread over nine times the area ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnrj4pfm44j3b8sbrfmhc3t))
- The receiving antenna presents a fixed area to the transmitter, so at two units it collects 1/4 of the power ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnrk3z2xzzxxmct5epk0epw))
- This reduction of power in proportion to the square of the distance is called the **inverse square law** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnrkt7jdm65w8rk24sh5vnx))
- the power collected by an antenna at a distance of *d* units will be (1/*d*)2 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnrmenwbmx529y9qgm6vb59))
- The inverse square law concerns relative power only ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnrs5jner0ymbqaqj3d6rpj))
- Just as the inverse square law deals with relative powers, it also deals with relative distances ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnrycq5vhn5ys0vvtfdmk43))
- measurements have shown that in urban environments, an inverse power law of three (cube) or four is a good representation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnsd5r6d2gf51frz88k78pr))
- For example, an inverse 3.5 power law is often a good description of attenuation for mobile telephony in urban areas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnsyje5vmb1yt2372af9fq2))
- ![](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/reader/parsed_document_assets/141610111/VBKf93gyerrnOp92D4y2bPVPcwBA_J4B6RzmGbnWiNg-asse_Ft8Yg44.jpg) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnsy89m2fq8tdrjz7sftgcg))
- attenuation can be advantageous for wireless communications. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnt1tfzgtd467h5b1cb013d))
- These frequencies can be re-used after a sufficient distance to avoid interference – the positive feature of attenuation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnt58era4zg2ps4mjwqscjb))
- One very common cluster is made up of seven cells, as shown at the bottom left of Figure 3.4. Figure 3.5 shows four adjacent **seven-**cell clusters – that is, each central cell is surrounded by six adjacent ones. Each cell has a base station operating on a particular frequency labelled *f*1 to *f*7. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnt9fbfp9fazb10746t0t8t))
- also highlights a twelve-cell cluster. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpntbr37acz1k3th8tn3tnnt))
- Different cell sizes are employed, depending on the density of users within the cell, and individual cells are clustered in order to ensure optimal frequency re-use. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpntdr3g6w5svnyaww63r171))
- in order to represent the analogue signal sufficiently well as a string of numbers – ultimately binary numbers – it is vital that two conditions are met. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpntnhyhzg5nfa15p7myf19v))
- signal must be sampled sufficiently frequently in order to represent all its significant fluctuations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpntnzmebq7my91x87jgjbtr))
- samples must be coded using a sufficiently accurate and precise number for each sample value ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpntpxev82vyytd33yr9sz1f))
- wrong impression of the original is due to sampling the signal too slowly and is called **aliasing**, because the reconstructed signal in Figure 3.9 made by ‘joining the dots’ is an alias of the original signal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpnv1r29jp9ptcp0y6hg4649))
- visual demonstration of aliasing is the so-called ‘wagon-wheel effect’ in movies ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpprysy03g72he1zpszh026p))
- To avoid aliasing when sampling a signal, there is a simple rule, known as the sampling theorem, which specifies the minimum theoretical sampling rate for a given signal:
  If a signal extends from very low frequencies to a maximum of *B* Hz, it must be sampled more frequently than 2*B* times per second.
  *B* is known as the bandwidth ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpps1p8q1mwx5mgyqvb85aj9))
    - Note: So twice the max frequency?
      Ave we talking about frequency or bandwidth?
- only nine **quantisation levels** cover the full range of 2 units. Clearly, a lot of detail is lost ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hppsb6qqp24670ddpfrmwz1k))
    - Note: Nothing move than the sensitivity in terms amplitude
- Precisely how many quantisation levels are required for a given application depends very much on the purpose ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hppsekyf3nrws3jkh2z9dgb6))
- in speech telephony, for example, is represented by an 8-bit data word and so can represent 256 different levels. This is sufficient to represent the human voice. But hi-fi music requires many more levels to capture a wider range of tones; a common music standard (CDs and some other digital formats) uses 16-bit words and thus 65,536 levels for each sample! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hppsf7jxk5d3m9er2m95yqza))
- A signal using 0 V to represent binary 0 and 1 V to represent binary 1.
  A signal like this can be transmitted directly as an electrical signal along (a moderately short) copper cable or by turning a laser on and off for long-distance transmission over optical fibre ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hppt5jaz96nn6k3jjnz8hzs9))
- the choice of symbol used to represents 0s and 1s (voltage, light intensity, and so on) is arbitrary, so long as it is agreed throughout the system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hppt69kcvznvq002fkkt6j28))
- for wireless transmission, the data has to be converted into a form that can be transmitted as an electromagnetic wave. There are a number of ways of doing this, known as modulation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hppt7kbmazs61yhv29h6nhvd))
- modulation schemes. They have the rather strange names on–off keying (OOK) and amplitude shift keying (ASK), terms dating from the use of a Morse ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpptarrez4t119f16wpfg3e8))
- the original binary signal simply modulates the amplitude (height) of the so-called carrier wave ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpptbm0t8bzx8sxrdjmecwvh))
- In OOK, the signal is simply represented by turning a sine wave on and off, while in ASK, two different amplitudes are used. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpptchcpe2c5apvastzstypm))
- alternative is to modulate the frequency of the carrier instead ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpptg058cgjgbz3vz6tfeghp))
- this technique is known as frequency shift keying (FSK). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpptge69a3awfakyrhtxenph))
- a more common and useful modulation scheme changes the phase of the transmitted wave ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hppzx0gdm9948tptxwr8m7t3))
- **phase shift** or **relative phase**, denotes how far a sine wave is shifted along the horizontal axis relative to another sine wave ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hppzxmrrhrx8636n0s6qf0ar))
- On the time axis of either graph, events to the right happen later than events to the left. Thus in the purple sine wave, the first positive peak occurs to the right of the first positive peak in the blue sine wave. The purple sine wave is said to be delayed or lagging ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpq00wcsmsvv813j4amzwre1))
- Alternatively, the purple sine wave is said to have a phase shift of minus ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpq018gtp79t313hnmpnedeh))
- Phase is a way of expressing a relationship between two sine waves. A sine wave cannot be said to have a particular phase except in relation to another sine wave. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpq01pcx0qpacttq2jram6sz))
- What makes it suitable to be a standard reference is the way the positive part of the cycle starts at *t* = 0. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpq03e9przmx4m51bm8nx637))
- If a sine wave is described as having a phase of, for example, +45°, without any explicitly stated reference sine wave, the reference sine wave is almost invariably one like that shown in Figure 3.15. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpq052711pj8stq2fafje46j))
- the phase shift is -180°, but as all cycles of the curve are identical, the phase shift could equally well be regarded as +180°. Note that the phase shift, which is half a cycle, corresponds to inverting the sine wave relative to the blue reference wave.
  Figure ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpq07b7dxhd9rdepefay9gks))
- the phase shift is -180°, but as all cycles of the curve are identical, the phase shift could equally well be regarded as +180°. Note that the phase shift, which is half a cycle, corresponds to inverting the sine wave relative to the blue reference wave. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpq08bp0te5zda4jtzte6zdn))
- the different ways a radio wave can be modulated in order to carry digital information: amplitude, frequency and phase shift keying ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpq14d3f0pg91ge0vqm9hjpk))
- how often and to what degree of precision an analogue signal has to be sampled in order to convey the necessary information ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpq14k77f5bp2me6jhp7g13m))
- Mobile telephony appeared in the UK in 1985 as an analogue system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpq16rr5ar28w687whvbws99))
- The first digital system (2G) that was introduced in Europe in 1991 is known as the GSM system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpq1726a70v7atgf1fn2v6fh))
- developed during the 1980s by the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpq18gkg80gqaha7a22rke14))
- transferred responsibility for European telephone standards to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpq18nyj2h6yf2b0753g5dqy))
- GSM frequency bands are either around 900 MHz or around 1800 MHz ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprahy53ntbs23yhjjb5vh2p))
- the band around 1800 MHz being considerably wider ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpraj2pvh3kewt5gmncam5a4))
- GSM has a cellular structure and employs frequency reuse ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprajfhytr37hzqt86j6jhth))
- At the lowest level are the interconnected mobiles, their cells and base stations – here termed **base transceiver stations (BTSs** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpraq1ap14e5wkzfsprrrrng))
- Above the air interface is the access network proper, which is the first stage in connecting the mobiles into wider networks such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprax6xxbpj12140gyf9wsdq))
- The access network basically consists of interfaces to the radio signals, together with a number of base station controllers (BSCs) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpraxyt10brgr3m51526hx26))
- A BSC may have tens or even hundreds of base stations under its control ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpraydgwevewfqg39vrazek1))
- The BSC handles the allocation of radio channels, receives measurements from the mobile phones, and controls most handovers from BTS to BTS as the user moves around. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpraytcw4n1pqy48jfkq5rhg))
- The core network contains a number of vital components ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprb7xvwjmndkq6yapze7t0d))
- **home location register (HLR)**. This stores permanent details about the user ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprb8d0svd0w4z39a87tqb1v))
- **vehicle location register (VLR)**. This term derives from when mobiles were restricted to automobiles ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprb8t7whwf5h8hed3527awn))
- holds temporary data about the user’s location, services permitted or disallowed, and so on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprb9ajy4v8revs7sty02sk6))
- updated as the user moves ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprb9vjtw2m147ad2ecj7c57))
- by the exchange of signals with the BSC and hence the user’s device when it is switched on or moves cell ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprbabrm58bwsbtsw1aea09f))
- **mobile switching centres (MSCs)** are responsible for routing voice calls and SMS texts ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprbbb2xzj498fqytdppvczs))
- They also set up and release **end-to-end connections** between two (or more) users ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprbbyw48fhdb28rwx1q35ap))
- they take care of charging and account monitoring. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprbce74qpv9s8zjad8smtkc))
- **Gateway MSCs (GMSCs)** are the MSCs that interface with the PSTN or other networks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprbdnane3m6v0czjzqazca1))
- the GSM system is that separate users are allocated individual time slots, as well as to a particular channel with a particular carrier frequency ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprc8b540vmswkebvb79tf8x))
- known as time-division multiple access (TDMA) and contributes to effective bandwidth utilisation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprc98r39g2x65qgqce8y2cm))
- systems divide their allocation of a band of the radio spectrum using a number of carrier frequencies, which allows several signals (usually eight telephone signals in GSM) to be digitised and time-division multiplexed together ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprcdg6rasskyry9xfae76r3))
- The multiplexed signal is then transmitted using a single carrier ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprcdt1hbtn0kjtbkkq1j9b3))
- for a simple case with just three signals. Samples from each of the three signals are interleaved on a regular and repeating basis ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprcywgqftkjmfbm04461fac))
- Each signal has its own time slot and so can be picked out individually at the receiver ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprcz2p4dwxsrrv8t9t4kgdt))
- eight time slots, transmitted sequentially for eight separate users, make up what is known as a TDMA frame ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprd1c9jeb9nfsg1c114389q))
- Each of the eight time slots lasts for 577 µs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprd1stg8waa1xc11yq9n483))
- It comprises a total of 148 bits ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprd6gbenk65r5fpeyrq95mh))
- only 114 represent voice or other data. The rest are used for a variety of control purposes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprd6rb79s0yqtxtqszb2kbe))
- Different frequency bands are used for transmitting from the user to the base station (the uplink) and from the base station to the user (the downlink). An individual user therefore has a time slot in a frame sent in the uplink and a time slot in the frame sent in the downlink. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hprd83y6gkqfpjb38a9ext1b))

- The system used ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpt1skq6457nwe7q9gvsn46v))
- is known as the universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpt1srrdgqk944mpsf88bfgj))
- It defines different quality of service (QoS) requirements for different data uses such as voice, text, pictures, audio and video. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpt1t5k2sd66rwqjk0f23ge2))
- A phone conversation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpt1y3e8axsj0wej57r8mzcy))
- requires low latency ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpt1y7ykyc913m7qdsn5bx9z))
- but is not very stringent on its data rate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpt1yf8mq651meae596bhbsz))
- Streaming video, on the other hand, requires high data rate, low packet loss and low jitter, but is not so stringent on latency ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpt20h2xq9zecjcb9qf603sh))
- Quite significant delays and jitter, unless excessive, hardly affect the loading of a web page, but the page needs to be received without error ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpt22sb6gga4renb5vng0p65))
- To achieve a more efficient use of the spectrum, UMTS has adopted frequency bands and a bandwidth-sharing method that both differ from GSM ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpvhesxgqtg695twft0hq0tt))
- The ITU initially allocated two 60 MHz bands for European UMTS: 1920–1980 MHz for the uplink and 2110–2170 MHz for the downlink ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpvhfgh2j82h60avzf77f02p))
- As the requirement for additional spectrum grew with the increased use of 3G UMTS, more frequency allocations were agreed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpvhgkjkkqyq8hx2995w3jbf))
- Not all bands are available in all countries, but the spectrum is managed on an international basis, to ensure roaming. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpvhgpq2rjs6cm9q0nj2fj5m))
- very different technique than in GSM called **code division, multiple access (CDMA)** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpvhhgeq1pv7p6tbghnf2bxz))
- special codes are used that enable separate streams of data (or voice calls) to be transmitted simultaneously over the same frequency band, but which can then be ‘disentangled’ by signal processing at the receiver ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpvhj655pepm81ybvg6cp0c3))

- When switched on, a Bluetooth device locates others by transmitting a message that alerts other Bluetooth devices in the vicinity. Any two Bluetooth-enabled devices can form an ad-hoc connection and establish a personal area network (PAN) with a small number of other devices, each being identified by its MAC address. (The term PAN sometimes also refers to short-range Wi-Fi networks.) Such a small network, often known as a piconet, is shown in Figure 3.28. One device in the piconet becomes the master unit and the others act as slaves, responding to ‘commands’ from the master. The master unit controls all aspects of the communication within the piconet, designating dedicated time slots when each slave can communicate. This prevents slaves from sending data simultaneously, and is another way of organising access control and avoiding collisions or contention between slaves for access to the master.

### 3.7 Error correction
- data signals suffer from the occasional error ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpya6m7w0mkyfses5fmdvrwh))
- agree that the listener should nod every time she receives a meaningful message. If the speaker sees the nod, he knows he can continue with the conversation. If not, he can repeat what he just said ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq01mn10ad38yyx1b4n5y2h9))
- automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol. As noted in Section 3.5.1, error correction in Wi-Fi networks uses such a protocol in which the sender waits for an acknowledgemen ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq01nwhjkqdrn8tecdwk1bcx))
- Another method ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq01xqp0tyq0mdypj454jmh8))
- speaker to repeat everything he says a few times, so that there is a better chance ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq01y4n9ffcp42ff34p5fe5c))
- The listener compares what the speaker said in each repetition and picks a version that seems most correct ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq01yj92gqa81hxvw403f8rs))
- this approach provides information to assist the listener in correcting for errors due to transmission, it is known as a forward error correction (FEC) code ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq01yzevc3gc2nxp453t1v01))
- one-way communication path from sender to receiver ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq02440cn5b6gjpyqa2hd7f2))
#### 3.7.1 Parity checks
- for a given block of bits, you add one further bit – the parity bit – which is chosen to be a 1 or a 0 so as to ensure that the total number of 1s in the block of bits, including the parity bit, is an even number. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq02k31ytz7q02n781hv5pfz))
- Any single error in the block will now make the parity of the block of bits odd, because an error changes either a 1 to a 0 or a 0 to a 1 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq02sq95m36q5ac8sdjxpst0))
- The receiver can therefore just count the number of 1s in the received block of bits; if the number is odd, it knows there has been at least one error ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq02tcqazw11e0rhdkh86yj9))
- Generally, however, systems operate with low error rates, meaning that the probability of there being more than one error in a block of bits is small ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq037c3brqrschcd0df6xn6b))
- correct errors, too ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq03caerpgesxx9aapd75zx8))
- The message digits are laid out in a rectangular block code with parity checks (all even or odd) for each row and column. Such a scheme can be used for FEC of a single error in a block, as shown in the following 7 × 5 message block with even parity digits, as before.

- This section has introduced one simple error detection scheme (simple parity check) and two correction schemes: the ‘best of three’; and a double parity check in a block of code words. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq03yhvc5fkzrfn5gcfq0tx4))
### 3.8 Security
- Wireless networks transmit data over a medium that is shared by everyone ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq046d4gvbt4tyefv4r077g9))
- The system should ensure that an eavesdropper is not able to convert these signals into the original message being transmitted. This is referred to as ensuring **confidentiality**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq046ktth8dxvjajv8tvs6y9))
- malicious users could interpose themselves between a sender and a receiver and modify the messages ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq047mkv8tmmsp43qasnfkpz))
- man-in-the-middle attack ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq047xaz191k7jnyq56es5a5))
- transmit lots of random data ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq048ngjt6b7jk1b691v8jvt))
- congesting the network ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq048tkz3m60t217w86fgqrz))
#### Encryption
- ensure both the confidentiality and the integrity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq04amfq4g4e5z9ymhmjjd87))
- plaintext message ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq04bdhdfd5mshey60pb8kks))
- transform it into ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq04bkhkfrevp03e94p1r1aq))
- ciphertext ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq04bpgq4nrgsqj6kbztfc6z))
- only the people who are supposed to receive the information are able to reverse the transformation and recover the plaintext. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq04c5zzyftc7z32ntmp32sf))
- transformation process ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq04cfzrkvrxkpjc9w1sk8cd))
- encryption function ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq04ck18ygg6xs04rv6ryehp))
- the reverse process is called a decryption function ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq04d0rje0cpmqt5c3t269ev))
- confidentiality, integrity and authentication ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq04dsp51x63k3j95cxk5a77))
- Confidentiality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq1323h23d0t9rpvzg2pck8x))
- When a message is encrypted using a particular key, it can be decrypted only if the same key is used ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq133nt4zqaqmp2mrzey805p))
- Integrity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq135gv37kxk0b4zpb5938b4))
- prevent messages from being modified without the receiver’s knowledge. The only way for a ‘man-in-the-middle’ attacker to modify a message is to decrypt it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq1362e02rt3zx6kqfs1wc30))
- Authentication ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq13bwr1jqq6cr5y0av7hm8p))
- the process of proving the identities of the sender and receiver ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq13c2d1ypdv0gcgqjdqyz7a))
- sender and receiver exchange some pre-defined messages that are encrypted using a key known only to them: an exchange called a security protocol ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq13dzktc915fa5pm1kpbv5e))
- One of the initial approaches to authenticating users was based on MAC addresses ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq13nt5t5e33h1rywf88a6pd))
- allowing only devices with pre-registered MAC ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq13p2mkb02yabg3v9ghaa9f))
- abandoned, because it was very easy for a user to change the MAC ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq13pb4f83n9y8xv6g8x94rn))
- Other Wi-Fi security mechanisms are based on encryption, using a key known only to the nodes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq13q6g5j8nnmzbx8fpm4m9b))
- The first of these mechanisms was called Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq13qfkzhm4y8jwmk9hfvt9v))
- However ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq13rtd7k97cnjzecg8ncx5m))
- allow the encryption key to be computed within a few minutes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq13ry483zyf4a11dmj12vne))
- the most popular security mechanism for home Wi-Fi networks is probably Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2), which uses a more secure key to encrypt the transmitted data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq13v3gf6cf492amnh3ckvy7))
- whilst it is possible to use WPA2 in ad-hoc mode wireless networks, this can be quite complicated to set up. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq13vsavh0raya495ndnyv3a))
- Bluetooth and ZigBee systems can be protected in similar ways to Wi ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq2m3t3wnbcbker4wvdnm1wk))
- however, the available security options are not always implemented by vendors and users ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq2m438f7fzxn5jw31kaz47j))
### 3.9 Regulation and Standardisation
#### 3.9.1 The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
- ITU is the United Nations specialized agency for information and communication technologies – ICTs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq2mct6hdg054sx2z3e1srb4))
- develop the technical standards that ensure networks and technologies seamlessly interconnect ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq2me03tqvv2e6jznp8hdghg))
- committed to connecting all the world’s people ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq2me9ya3zh444jn344fqk7q))
- We’re unique among UN agencies in having both public and private sector membership. So in addition to our 193 Member States, ITU membership includes ICT regulators, many leading academic institutions and some 700 tech companies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq2mhrsf918xmczhxzektr6z))
- The main products of ITU-T (ITU-Telecommunications) are Recommendations (ITU-T Recs) – standards defining how telecommunication networks operate and interwork ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq2mjm3vkhwv4dqqpn3src8s))
- There are over 4000 Recommendations in force ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq2mnjrcam96sfqrm0jm93bn))
#### 3.9.2 The IEEE family of standards
- I take this extract to mean that although they are widely adopted, and have effectively become standards in practice for many branches of ICT, IEEE regulations do not have legal force in the same way as those of the ITU-T ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq2nhtnt6gmvb8b74pccgbja))
