- Summary: The internet has evolved into a global platform where diverse voices can express their opinions, threatening authoritarian governments that try to suppress dissent. While many users enjoy freedom of expression online, some countries, like China, enforce strict censorship that leads to self-policing among users. Social media has transformed how people access news, but it also facilitates the spread of fake news, creating challenges for society.

## Highlights
### Introduction
- Barlow, and fellow activists, saw the internet as an invention that would bridge cultural divides, a place where politics, race, religion and economic arguments would be irrelevant.
### The changing internet and the changing internet culture
- The public gained access to the internet in 1989, but it was 1991’s introduction of the world wide web that transformed the internet utterly
- This explosive growth was driven by two inventions
- web browsers
- point-and-click interfaces
- HTML
- In 1996, Barlow’s *Declaration* was written during a wave of innovation that hinted at the internet’s potential to transform the world
- the potential for the internet to transform shared experiences was recognised extremely early
- 1997, Nicholas Negroponte, founder of the MIT Media Lab, coined the term *‘The Daily Me’* to describe an electronic newspaper
- *The Daily Me* would use the reader’s preferences and previous behaviour to select interesting material
### The challenges of the internet
- challenges posed not only by the increasing influence of the internet on our lives, but also by the challenges to the internet from governments
### 6.1 Freedom of speech
- The Oxford Dictionaries definition of free speech focuses on the speaker. Expressing opinions is, however, a communicative act, and this requires both a source (the speaker) and a target (the audience)
- Barlow’s *Declaration* proposed that the internet would be a place where freedom of speech was absolute
- uch opinions would be drowned out
- Free speech is not restricted to verbal communications
#### 6.1.1 Freedom of speech in law
- freedom of speech is recognised as a fundamental
- However, the same article places limitations
##### Article 10 Freedom of expression
- This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing
- The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties
- In 1948, the newly formed General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)
#### 6.1.2 One right amongst many
- laws list exceptions to the right to exercise one’s freedom of speech
- If two rights collide, it is necessary to decide which is the most important
- United States
- ruled that it was legal for the US government to ban pamphlets
- free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theater
##### The right to offend
- in many countries, including democracies, there are restrictions on certain forms of expression precisely to protect people from offence
##### The limits of freedom of speech
- freedom of speech only protects individuals from abuses of power by governments. It is not a violation of freedom of speech for a private organisation to forbid the discussion of certain topics, or to refuse to publish, delete or edit content.
### 6.2 Censors
- Authoritarian regimes retain power by restricting free speech through state control of the media and universal press censorship
- many have turned to technology to crush dissenting voices. Ironically, most of this technology is imported from Western democracies
- Libertarians think of people as ‘full self-owners’: any decision affecting a person should, as far as possible, be made by that person themselves
- in representative **democracies**, people freely choose representatives, who then make decisions on their behalf
#### 6.2.1 The People’s Republic of China
- The Communist Party of the People’s Republic of China maintains total control of domestic print and broadcast media
- 1995, and the few people then able to afford a connection experienced a brief window of open access to information before the first blocks
- Systematic controls on the internet within China are largely based on legislation known as CL97
- allow for the blocking of any service considered “harmful to national security”
- the government stressed the need for Chinese companies to develop an internet with ‘Chinese characteristics’
#### 6.2.2 Golden Shield
- Golden Shield – known in the West as The Great Firewall of China
- system of surveilling and censoring internet traffic both within China and data requested from abroad
- in 2006.
- operated by the Public Security Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security
- linked to internet routers maintained by all Chinese internet service providers.
##### IP address blocks
- block users from connecting to banned sites by maintaining a centralised deny list (also referred to as a block list) of blocked IP numbers
- simple to implement
- effective method
- weakness of IP address blocking
- t packets can be routed
##### DNS injection
- process is performed by a hierarchy of Domain Name System (DNS) servers
- a certain number of requests will be directed to DNS servers located outside of China.
- intercepted by Golden Shield and the request is duplicated
- The second copy is directed into a fake DNS
- This server investigates the request
- deep packet inspection.
- If the requested URL is blocked, the fake DNS server generates an apparently genuine reply message that will direct the user’s computer to an invalid IP number
##### Resetting connections
- Deep packet inspection
- Golden Shield terminates communication sessions if they contain any of some 15,000 keywords
- the firewall sends a series of ‘reset’ packets
- packets whose IP numbers falsely identify the reset as coming from the remote computer
- cannot be used on encrypted communications
##### Prefix hijacking
- The process that allows data to be routed between differing networks is known as the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) running on edge routers.
- layer of censorship on the edge routers by inserting false routes into the routing tables, a process known as prefix hijacking
#### 6.2.3 The Chinese internet
- Golden Shield prevents Chinese users from using services
- Chinese companies have developed comparable services
- Internet searches are dominated by Baidu
- Weibo is China’s largest social media platform
- Bing is available within China
- Between 2003 and 2007, Yahoo! cooperated with Chinese authorities to identify three Chinese nationals – Shi Tao, Li Zhi and Wang Xiaoning
#### 6.2.4 Why Golden Shield succeeds in its purpose
- Golden Shield is largely invisible to users from within China.
- the Chinese government makes it quite clear to its citizens that it monitors communications and exercises censorship
- knowledge that any communication *may* be monitored and that records *may* be kept of attempts to access ‘unsuitable’ content has created a culture of self-censorship
#### 6.2.5 Censorship in democratic countries
- many countries which boast of their human rights records and protections for free speech have either implemented or suggested censoring
- Australian government
- British internet service providers have introduced a content blocking technology known as Cleanfeed
- Finland restricts the right to publish material discussing copy protection schemes
- Quebec in Canada has passed legislation blocking access to online gambling sites
### 6.3 Search engine bias
- In countries without systemic surveillance, the internet appears to offer perfect freedom of expression
- Who created all these documents?
- Do these links point to high-quality, factual resources, to incorrect information, or to advertising?
- If the material is of varying quality, were the best resources prioritised
- have some resources been given greater visibility because their creators have paid
- were any results suppressed
#### 6.3.1 Are search engines bad for your health?
- Childhood vaccinations are a routine part of life
- growing public concern over possible adverse consequences
- began with the publication of a paper by the prestigious *Lancet* journal in 1998
- Follow-up studies failed to substantiate the *Lancet* paper
- had faked some findings, and had direct financial interests
- scientific consensus is that there is no evidence of a link between vaccination and developmental conditions such as autism
- a belief that vaccinations cause certain chronic childhood conditions persists – especially online
- Researchers at the University of California (Ruiz and Bell, 2014) studied how people encounter misleading information
- Nine search terms were selected
- The first page of Google results, containing ten results, was retrieved
- researchers were interested in
- **myths** and **recommendations**.
##### The number of myths
- he majority of sites contained factual information, myths were found on 16.7% of the websites
- Negative search terms returned 28 useful results; on average, each of these results contained 1.93 myths about vaccination
- the choice of search term dramatically alters the likelihood that someone searching for information about vaccination will see falsehoods
- who is concerned about possible risks of vaccination, and who is likely to use a negative term such as *‘vaccine risk’*
##### Countering myths
- The number of myths that were countered varied
- surprisingly, positive searches were the least effective
- The researchers also studied how many myths were countered compared to those that they perpetuated
- negative web searches were the least effective at countering
##### Explicit recommendations
- significant differences between the number of recommendations made by performing different types of search
- the reliability of search engine results can be influenced by the choice of search terms
- The study’s authors strongly suggest that sites offering accurate information about vaccination *must* include information about myths and why they are false.
- creators of positive pages knew the benefits of vaccination and assumed their potential audience were of a similar mind
- ensure factual information *always* appears high
#### 6.3.2 Can a search engine change an election result?
- In the USA, 73% of online adults used the internet for campaign-related purposes during the 2010 midterm elections
- 2015 study (Epstein and Robertson, 2015) experimented with the effect search rankings may have on voting intentions.
- Three experimental groups each of 34 representative voters
- asked to read short biographies of Tony Abbott and Julia Gillard
##### How the experiment was conducted
- Each experimental group was then subdivided into three subgroups. Participants were asked to perform individual research on the candidates using a mock search engine
- results were identical between subgroups, but each subgroup saw the results in a different order
- Subgroup 1 received results where the highest-ranking results portrayed Gillard as the better candidate
- Subgroup 2’s received the opposite
- Subgroup 3’s results did not favour either candidate.
- monitored the amount of time the voters spent examining each page
- and which links they clicked
- voters’ perceptions of candidates changed alongside their voting intentions depending on which set of search results they received
##### Experimenting with voters in an upcoming election
- the researchers conducted a third, much larger study involving 2150 voters
- on Indian voters
- revealed many similarities between diverse electorates.
- especially effective in changing the opinions of people who are not especially interested in politics
- voters were disproportionately affected by the first few results
- studies showed that manipulated results could shift the votes of previously undecided voters by 20% or more
- the Indian experiment produced a swing of 72.7% in voting intentions amongst unemployed male voters in the Kerala region
- many elections are won or lost by relatively small margins
### 6.4 Filter bubbles
- the referendum that saw Britain leave the EU was won by 3.8%
- social media differs in that our choices affect future interactions
- Social media continuously and invisibly curates our world view by promoting content with which we are likely to positively engage
- The internet activist Eli Pariser named this selective view a filter bubble
#### 6.4.1 How filter bubbles shape our view of the world
- ability of filter bubbles to affect our perception of the world became clear in August 2014
- police shooting of Michael Brown
- in the Ferguson suburb
- some users, the Ferguson disturbances did not appear in Twitter’s list of trending hashtags
- topics were determined by algorithms and that trends were personalised to individual users
- volume of interest
- rate at which interest in a topic changed
- user’s location
- how the user had used Facebook in the past
- information from other accounts the user followed
- Ferguson demonstrated how filter bubbles within social media could distort peoples’ view of the world.
#### 6.4.2 Editorial bias and fake news
- Facebook appointed a small staff of human editors to oversee the ‘Trending’ topics
- this editorial team were politically biased against right-wing politicians
- Facebook formally denied
- Facebook laid off every person responsible for curating ‘Trending’ topics, reverting to a purely algorithmic approach
- Three days after introducing automatic curation
- The story was false; Facebook’s algorithms had blindly promoted a story from a minor blog
- the internet’s unique ability to allow any user to publish material without authoritative sources or the intervention of an editor allows fake news to run riot.
#### 6.4.3 Taming the algorithms
- several major changes aimed at reducing the spread of false information
- Make it easier for users to report fake stories
- Mark stories whose authenticity is disputed
- Facebook now works with independent fact-checking services
- a link to the fact-checking report is placed next to them
- Examine users’ sharing patterns to identify fake news
- a trend amongst users to preferentially share false stories without reading the article
- Attack spammers and trolls
- Facebook has refused to arbitrate whether stories are true or not, arguing that it is a platform where anyone can post information
- it is an open question how long it can avoid issues over freedom of speech, censorship and responsibility for its content.
- The world is not simple, and we should not expect simple answers 
  from it.
