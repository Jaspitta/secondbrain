- Document Note: According to the document, an area is a realm of daily habits, meaningful rituals, and timeless values that transcend any particular project, while projects end and areas continue indefinitely. Every project typically falls under an area of responsibility. On the other hand, resources are the material related to each project or goal, organized in one place. They could be fields or trends you’re curious about, such as parenting, cryptocurrency, or artificial intelligence. Resources can also include your hobbies and passions. The line between areas and resources is an opportunity to be completely honest with yourself, to determine what is inside the circle of your responsibilities, which no one else is going to take care of for you, and what is outside.

## Highlights
- Books are not trophies to collect or evidence you’ve learned anything.
  The only reward from reading a book like this one comes from ***putting what you***
  ***learn into practice***, and you can do that after you’ve read just the first five
  chapters. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h89yspydma79yzq2j8mbh88q))
- Such a system would need to be incredibly easy to set up, and even easier to maintain. After all, only the simplest, most frictionless habits endure long term. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h89z09e2zwjxc1ky8bgyj639))
- there are only four categories that encompass all the information in your life. [**4**](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/82265908#p29) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h89z6j3vbwmy00keh5q6f270))
    - Note: I wonder if this has something to do with the 4 chunk slots we have in our working memory
- Short-term efforts in your work or
  **PROJECTS** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h89z6wsfh7keyz4rmg086z3q))
- Long-term responsibilities you want
  **AREAS**
  to manage over time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h89z7bxjsh6n2hgmn42cqwsh))
- Topics or interests that may be
  **RESOURCES**
  useful in the future ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h89z7h79pvr0yazardccxd9k))
- Inactive items from the other three
  **ARCHIVES**
  categories ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h89z7v9cbpc8c03pn91gdt4s))
    - Note: Ao this will always have 3 folders for the inactive versions of the one above
- if your organizational system is as complex as your life, then the demands of maintaining it will end up robbing you of the time and energy you need to live that life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h89zfctkdcrhs0e1afxegga8))
- Instead of organizing information according to broad subjects like in school, I advise you to organize it according to the projects and goals you are committed to right now.
  This is what it means to “organize for action,” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h89zjhyb4xbd57q7bns37724))
- Projects are “short-term efforts,” which means they need a clear end date. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8a9rxcmb8rm1q78qct43d8t))
    - Note: Not necessarily a date but a condition after which it can be considered finishe like a book
- break down your areas of responsibility into specific, concrete projects. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8a9v9h3xmay1ey5dxbjtsy5))
- What does our motivation depend on? Mostly, on making consistent progress. We can endure quite a bit of stress and frustration in the short term if we know it’s *leading somewhere.*
  Which brings us to our second problem: without a list of individual projects, you can’t connect your current efforts to your long-term goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8aa06sqbaa4ab06c9dze190))
- It is about identifying the structure of your work and life—what you are committed to, what you want to change, and where you want to go. It is about organizing information in such a way that it supports and calls into being the future life you want to lead. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8aa527vt2vcvhpy7kqzgf7b))
- We tell ourselves we’re “getting ready” or “doing research,”
  pretending like that means progress. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8aa5jpapbvb42nzew5mfaqd))
    - Note: Man I feel this so hard
- Step 1: Archive existing files
  • Step 2: Create project folders
  • Step 3: Create additional folders ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8aa98tb65y4xyhy2r6php16))
- It needs a place to go for safekeeping—one that is secure but completely “out of sight, out of mind” until you need it.
  That place is the Archives. Think of it like “cold storage” for your digital life ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8aaj6841kz77d4p4g4a2003))
    - Note: Funny enough cold storage is actually a type of storage
- move them all at once into a new folder called “Archive [Today’s date].” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8aam45khjkbphnxjte68wdh))
- You can go ahead and start moving any documents, notes, or files you’re actively working with into the appropriate project folders, but don’t feel the need to do it up front or all at once. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8aarsm5jb3ctfd5fp4d5y9w))
- never create an empty folder (or tag, or directory, or other container) before you have something to put in it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8c76drhyg7ctc6mbhpg8t59))
    - Note: Note that tags are also valid from what he is saying here
- Which resources are truly valuable, and which could you easily find again with a Google search? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8c7atcm9wzsw2eeh95hk8wn))
- **Create an Inbox**
  In the midst of a hectic week, you won’t usually have time to perfectly capture, title, and file away new items as they arrive. Which means you need a separate time and place to “process” new items. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8c7ds7bt9efrmdw0yfbmp3y))
- I suggest adding the numbers 0–4 at the beginning of the titles for each of the five folders you now have. Using “0” for the inbox reminds you that its contents have not yet been processed. This keeps them in the right order from most to least actionable when they are sorted alphabetically. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8c7epmnss79natyk4vbanz6))
- • Emojis at the beginning of titles for project folders
  • Capitalized titles for area folders
  • Uncapitalized titles for resource folders ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8c7hyt82kgnyzy41rpv1zwb))
    - Note: I do not like to use emojis since they are not really basic characters
- I’ve also seen people make do with only two, such as a “Hot” folder for anything currently actionable and a “Cold” folder for everything that’s not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8c9j0mkjvpkh1t9fsfkpn67))
    - Note: This is interesting
- The important principle is to separate out whatever is most actionable and timely and give it the majority of your attention ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8c9k94khc44g2kwmpn753ry))
- For that reason, I recommend you do all the upkeep of your PARA system in just five minutes per week. All you need to do is follow these three easy steps:
  1. Retitle new items in your inbox
  2. Sort new items into PARA folders
  3. Update your active projects ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8cr91pt9rhszs8feygg98v9))
- ![](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/reader/parsed_document_assets/82265908/id35-index-63_1.jpg) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8crm2gr66x5mqjvpw2w54nz))
- • Changing the name of a project to reflect a new scope or direction
  • Splitting a large project into smaller ones to make it more achievable
  • Archiving a project that has been completed, put on hold, canceled, or handed over to someone else
  • Unarchiving a dormant project ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8crq4yjqan5a2trgqr3pv9t))
- There is tremendous power in changing your organizational system to fit your
  evolving needs and goals, instead of
  trying to force your needs and goals to fit
  your system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8crtfpvvj948y8m5q6za6rj))
- Don’t think of the Archive as an “idea graveyard” where information goes to die. Your archives represent the sum total of your life experience, a treasure ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8crvkzsv3tet7r9ntwzjxxv))
- The Archive should be your starting point any time you launch a new project, do a personal year-end review, or update your résumé for a new job. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8crwhvqyy3h832r3swxhres))
    - Note: where you go to get reference of the past that you can leverage in your favor and build a better future
- **Projects: A Goal with a Deadline** My definition of a project is any endeavor that has: 1. A **goal** that will enable you to mark it “complete”
  2. A **deadline** or timeframe by which you’d like it done ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8cs6s2mhdrhj91p89qtny79))
    - Note: I am not a big fan of deadlines since they never worked for me
- There are facets of your work and life that don’t have a clear end goal or deadline. We call them “areas of responsibility.”
  An area of responsibility has:
  1. A **standard** to be maintained
  2. An **indefinite** end date
  Work-related areas include your job duties, whether that is management, customer service, financial analysis, strategy, coaching, direct reports, or advising. You also have areas of responsibility in your personal life, like your health, finances, personal development, and relationships, which will continue in some form for as long as you live. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8csds87f9rp3h93e8mnah85))
    - Note: By this standard it feels like nothing will ever go in the archive
- Every project typically falls under an area of responsibility. For example:
  • Running a marathon is a project, which falls under the area of Health
  • Publishing a book is a project, which falls under the area of Writing
  • Saving three months’ worth of expenses is a project, which falls under the area of Finances
  • Planning an anniversary dinner is a project, which falls under the area of your Spouse
  Although projects and areas are related, it’s critically important that you distinguish between them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8csn027n9pmrvdxyd64x0za))
    - Note: So what should I do when it is completed?
- Once you view your life through the lens of projects and areas, it becomes very clear that you need both: sprints to ramp up something new, and marathons to sustain it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8f3vvjvn7x8mqaam9dbv7je))
- The key here is to realize that there is a big difference between *things* *you are directly responsible for* and *things you are merely interested in*. I use uppercase titles for areas and lowercase titles for resources to constantly remind myself that one is more important than the other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8f3zckpg7akqtxqn27y496y))
- Although you may feel a lot of enthusiasm for these pursuits, I recommend using the relatively cold word “resources” for a very specific reason. I am a naturally curious person with dozens, if not hundreds of different subjects I’d like to know more about. But I also know my tendency is to collect too much and become a “digital hoarder.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8f4620napm0jgpftr1kk2js))
- Areas Are Private Whereas Resources Are Shareable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8f499s48zqdtrrsmva3ken5))
- The line between areas and resources is an opportunity to be completely honest with yourself: What is inside the circle of your responsibilities, which no one else is going to take care of for you, and what is outside? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8f4frq08qaa3de68bezn0kf))
- Instead of fighting the tide and looking for “one
  app to rule them all,” use as many apps as you like, while replicating the *same structure* across every single one ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8f7m9wn619esbq016q0ndzt))
- I use the following rules of thumb to tell me which digital storage medium is best for any given piece of information: 1. If it’s an **appointment or meeting** happening at a specific time, it goes on my **calendar**
  2. If it’s a **task** that I can complete anytime, it goes in my **to-do list app** 3. If it’s **text**, it goes in my **notetaking app** (since that offers the best search function by which to find it again)
  4. If it’s **content that I’ll be collaborating on with others**, it goes in my [**cloud storage drive10**](#p91)
  5. **If it can’t go in any of the above locations** (because it’s too large or a specialized file type, for example), then it goes in my **computer’s file system** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hksjfzd792021rxmdm374n))
- ![](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/reader/parsed_document_assets/82265908/id43-index-88_1.jpg) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hktwd933x3ghdfpw48cybj))
- if I want to save a sensitive piece of information—a tax document, credit card details, medical data, or passwords for example—I save it in an encrypted password manager app to make sure no one can access it except me. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hkvd2kftfmxqjwqc3yz77c))
- you should create a folder on any platform only when you have something to put in it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hkw7ztsyyzts0f7gps04f4))
- Many categories of information can exist on only one platform
  —extend them across multiple platforms only if needed to move a project forward. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hkydhtk8t4zbafbba6es62))
- Tasks are usually part of projects, but sometimes you can have a “free-floating” task that falls within an area and isn’t part of any particular project. For example, “Correct typo on website” stands alone as part of a “Website” area. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hpcrqabb4q6j95fv22h4g4))
- New projects often emerge out of existing areas of responsibility. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hrf87mba6gz6ypjcccapk5))
    - Note: For me I think they will emerge more from my inbox if that make sense
- The only action I recommend avoiding at all costs is duplication: you never want to have two versions of a file or document, because then you never know which one is the most current. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hrm27g04p45t717q8cxptt))
- Here are my top four recommendations for how to do that using PARA within teams:
  1. Get clear on your organization’s flavor of PARA 2. Train people in how to use PARA
  3. Keep only shared projects on shared platforms 4. Encourage a culture of writing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hrv0nkqzmev0ezbmaz3k72))
- a document, note, or other digital item is a message being sent through time to a future recipient. Like any message, the *quality* of that communication determines whether it is likely to be received and understood on the other end. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hs60p10yrqzjzhfn15zy2a))
- A high-quality piece of communication meets the following criteria:
  • Is it interesting and attention-grabbing? (Does it make people *want* to read it?)
  • Is it precise and clear? (Can people easily understand what it’s trying to say?)
  • Is it empathetic? (Is it written to be understood from the reader’s point of view?)
  • Does it help people solve a problem? (Is it clearly useful and effective?)
  • Does it inspire people to take action? (Does it make it easy for others to apply it?) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hs6h07617rrn2nsr6w6yax))
- Formulating your Project List is an incredibly useful exercise in its own right, as well as the cornerstone of PARA ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hscx2wd271spt3xc0jsm0v))
- Set a timer for five minutes (which is enough for a “first pass”) and write down anything that comes to mind when you read the following questions, whether they are work-related or personal:
  • What’s currently worrying you?
  • What problem is taking more mental bandwidth than it deserves?
  • What needs to happen that you’re not making consistent progress on?
  • What actions are you already taking that are part of a bigger project you’ve not yet identified?
  • What would you like to learn, develop, build, express, pursue, start, explore, or play with?
  • Which skills would you like to learn and which hobbies would you like to start?
  • What kind of project could advance your career or make your life more fun or interesting? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hsemfktrdzbmc02p2fq4re))
- Add a Goal for Each Project ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hsf13wg3rxf5n191y7f36v))
- Next, go through the list one more time and add completion dates. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hsgw1pnr9vbz5bx7jw6jxh))
- **Prioritize Your List**
  You aren’t very likely to make progress on every single project on your list in a given week, or even most of them. The key here is to prioritize *only for the upcoming week*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hsjgwfgtn4xwgfmamnkjh4))
- Reevaluate Your Project List ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hsjw8dj0qbbn0s1sgtf0x3))
- • Which goals or priorities you say are important to you don’t have any projects associated with them? (These are called
  “dreams,” since they aren’t likely to happen in the near term.)
  • Which projects you’re spending a lot of time on don’t have any goals associated with them? (These are called “hobbies,”
  because without a goal in mind, they are likely “just for fun.”)
  • Which projects can you cancel, postpone, reduce in scope, delegate, outsource, or clarify? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hsmfwjcvhrqqgspc4tbc12))
- The five steps I’ve just taken you through can become part of a
  “weekly review.” You can walk through them once a week, or anytime you feel overwhelmed or stretched too thin, and I guarantee you’ll emerge in minutes with a newfound sense of clarity and purpose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8hsp88pfmxcdf5dfkxv9xs4))
- My organizing philosophy is to organize as little as possible, as late as possible, and only as much as absolutely needed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2xdeeeff5vjcdvt0ymcbq3))
- imposing order on information doesn’t always make it more valuable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2xgr4zfv0rmcmm453x14m4))
- Allowing some messiness and randomness into the system creates opportunities for very different ideas to be connected and intermixed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha2xhgeb3ehx2x8xgbxcfrz5))
- Projects include actions that need to be taken and information that needs to be reviewed in the next few hours or days. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha5eczkjs9xh6bm8rsj75wsc))
- By separating out the information in your life according to *when it will be* *needed*, PARA gives you a sense of perspective appropriate to whichever time horizon is calling for your attention ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha5ehaet8j0g39kryfgvjd4t))
- Getting organized is not about aesthetics, or the way things look.
  Don’t be lured into believing that a workspace full of squared edges, clean lines, and minimalistic whitespace will somehow magically grant you clarity or peace of mind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb3nrmmhw33968zew8je23y0))
- By surrounding yourself with information that provokes a feeling of fascination, you’ll begin to harness the incredible enthusiasm for learning and growth you have trapped inside.
  Power comes from systems that don’t depend on your energy levels, attention span, or self-discipline. That’s why PARA asks you to make one decision for each piece of information, and one decision only: When will this be relevant next? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb3nx71ewswvf1tmpfyet197))
- There is a common temptation to set up PARA to resemble the life you *wish you had*, instead of the life you actually have. Don’t create a bunch of aspirational projects ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb3nz5gps18xq4n38nt0swdw))
