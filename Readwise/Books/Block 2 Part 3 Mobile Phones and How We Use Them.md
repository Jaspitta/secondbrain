#### 3.2.2 Cameras
- Many modern mobile phones contain two cameras – one that is front-facing and another that is back-facing. Of course, the primary function of the cameras is for taking photographs, but when working with other sensors and some clever algorithms, they can be used to measure the angle between two lines, determine the height and distance of an object from the mobile phone, and recognise objects. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxcd2p96gne9qtpqvbxf9vgm))
- Most image sensors are now of the active pixel sensor (APS) type ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxcd8tj2p0ds1ey98nydxkn2))

- measures a force called a Coriolis force ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxm0f89rhc3cg1mrq8q7qbmw))
##### The Coriolis force
- Suppose an object is placed on a rotating disc ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxm0jw0zxhfbxmz2skdjneky))
- it will make the same number of revolutions per second as the disc ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxm0k4qn595edg2nynf5jvk7))
- velocity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxm0kjy8zmtyav0cqd6b6h62))
- depends on how quickly the disc is rotating and the distance of the object from the centre ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxm0ksnt38k3sdzqzc21dchx))
- We can see that as the object in Figure 3.9 moves away from the centre of the rotating disc, its velocity increases ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxm0r3p6kq4mffmwtykskdca))
- If the object moves toward the centre of the rotating disc, its velocity decreases ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxm0r77mjgp1es8cm196jfww))
- changes in the velocity of the object mean that the object experiences an inertial force ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxm0rg1efsygpymtnfeq5ws5))
- in the opposite direction to the direction of the acceleration ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxm0t19xtthnsbnq7bcyhf2t))
- this inertial force is called a Coriolis force ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxm0thngfe01b0k5ezw31bfk))

- the vibrating mass moves away from the centre ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxm2mt00spav83n9zvsjs08b))
- the velocity of the inner frame increases ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxm2mzt9k4kz37z4w3bbd5p3))
- the Coriolis force on the mass causes the inner frame to move in the opposite direction ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxm2n92nspj55wam8nmjj2rz))
- movement of the inner frame within the fixed outer frame causes a change in the distance between the Coriolis sense fingers, and the resulting change in capacitance is converted to an electrical signal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxm2r7j7wg3j5btdkg2dn8kz))
