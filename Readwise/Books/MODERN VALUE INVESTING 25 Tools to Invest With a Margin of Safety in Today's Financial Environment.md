- Summary: Value investing involves thinking independently and buying stocks that are undervalued, especially during market downturns. By focusing on tangible assets and the intrinsic value of businesses, value investors can find great opportunities while others panic. The key is to look for bargains in complex situations, as the market often misprices stocks, allowing for lower risk and higher returns.

## Highlights
- Capable to clearly distinguish between stock price fluctuations and underlying business reality.

- this moment in time, what few understand is that the huge increase in passive investment vehicles will become self-defeating because who is going to adjust market prices to new information if everybody invests in index funds?

- just look at the people around you that have a stock portfolio or some other kind of investments and ask yourself whether those people have the knowledge and the mindset to make rational financial decisions all the time and make proper risk reward calculations. 
  You have probably arrived at the conclusion that most of the people you know don’t have the necessary knowledge to make rational investing decisions. Well, all those people are the market, because each one of us owns a little piece of the global equity world, be it directly or through investment funds. As the majority of us does not behave rationally when it comes to making financial decisions, the whole market can consequently be defined as irrational.
- secondly, when the risks are highest according to standard deviation models, it seems that they are in fact the lowest because there is no other way for stocks to go other than up. What determines your return is never risk but something much simpler; price.
- Asymmetrical risk reward is the essence of investing in stocks, and is also essential for those who want to beat the market. An asymmetrical risk reward situation can be both positive and negative. A positive one is where you can only lose an amount that is smaller than the potential reward for the same probability.
  A negative risk reward situation is one where you can lose more than what the potential positive reward is.
  By patiently filling your portfolio with positive asymmetric risk reward investments you will reach extremely high returns for little risk, which is the point of value investing.
- By focusing on the risks first and only if the risks are small then on returns, you can find asymmetric risk reward situations that will enable you to maximize your returns and minimize your risks.
- It is crucial to understand that whatever happens in the stock market, the large majority of people are just going to continue living as they have been living and this will be reflected on most businesses’ revenues and earnings in the long term.
- The logical thing is that you see the world, gather data and then act on it. Reflexivity adds a step onto it where your thinking and actions also affect the world you are viewing, thus the world is always uncertain and unstable, and your thinking is fallible.
- the more you know the lower is the uncertainty. Unfortunately, the uncertainty part of investing can never be totally removed.
- I wanted to discuss behavioral finance and reflexivity here because I often see value investors get completely infatuated with fundamentals that look extremely valuable and consequently the stock is undervalued but the stock market never catches up. Actually, the opposite is true; the fundamentals often catch up with the stock, be it upwards or downwards. Thus, reflexivity should be another check to perform before approaching an investment.
- The four methods are: net present value analysis (NPV), liquidation value, the stock market value and the value to the private owner.
- The net present value is the discounted value of all future cash flows a business is expected to generate.
- One can also use earnings instead of future cash flows
- The book value of a company represents the accounting value of the company. It’s very rare to find a company that has its book value equal to its liquidation value. For example, buildings are usually depreciated within 20 to 50 years. So, if a company bought a building 40 years ago, the value of that building on the balance sheet could easily be zero, but if the company would put the same building for sale, the value would probably be much higher than what the company paid for it four decades ago.
- debt can usually be taken at face value.
- it’s perhaps better to stay away from companies with large or potentially large pension liabilities.
- As the change in book value shows only what happened in the past the best way to approach the analysis of intrinsic value is by combining the following three factors: book value, earnings and expected future return on retained earnings.
- ROIC = net income / capital (equity plus long and short-term debt)
- The current book value adjusted by dividend payments and historical cost accounting issues will show you the value created in the past that you are buying now. Current earnings or the change in book value will show you the value that is created at the moment you are analyzing the stocks. The third component; return on capital will tell you what to expect in the long term as that is the actual future value creation.
- Sometimes a stock is undervalued because it is in a process of building a new hotel, pipeline, mine, or whatever kind of investment where the value will be returned only in a few years. The market usually discounts such projects at a much larger rate than normal, creating excellent investing opportunities for the patient and intelligent value investor.
- If you follow 10 stocks like Starbucks, I would bet that every year, one of those stocks, due to some temporary issues or negative sector sentiment, would definitely fall below a conservative growth calculation of intrinsic value.
- Margins that will likely improve with more scale will lead to value creation and vice versa.
- Companies that have healthy growth rates but valuations below the market average and a stable business model will probably deliver strong earnings in the long term even if their book values aren’t really indicating that there is much value there at the moment.
- If you want even better returns than what you can get from rebalancing the S&P 500 and globally, you have to look at individual stocks that are in a temporarily weak sector but are still doing well and perhaps even growing. The growth might not be coming from earnings (as the sector is in trouble), but could come from acquisitions as the best acquisitions are made when assets are cheap.
- Given that China and India have been growing at staggering rates in the past 10 years, corporate earnings have also been booming, which skews the CAPE metric because of past low earnings. Therefore, be sure to adjust the usage of the CAPE by also analyzing the growth of the respective stock, sector or country. You can adjust a CAPE ratio by looking at how much the earnings have fallen in the last economic or sector contraction, and apply the same decline to future expected earnings derived from current earnings.
- The time to buy stocks trading below net cash value is in market downturns when pessimism surrounding the whole market creates high selling pressure and pulls all stock prices down. A combination of 1) sound fundamentals, 2) a business that operates profitably, 3) low debt, and 4) more cash than the market capitalization is the ultimate margin of safety investment.
- That being said, the best way to go about analyzing moats is to compare the analyzed business with the competition and potential competition. If it is really difficult to find a threat to the business, that business might have a large moat.
- Low Cost Provider
- High Switching Costs
- The Network Effect
- Strong Brand Name
- Reputation
- Economies of scale
- Government Protection
- When analyzing a commodity, which is usually cyclical, the thing to analyze are the average mining costs and the trends in the sector.
- If supply is constrained while demand is constantly growing, you have found a winner.
- If there is no probability that the company will go bankrupt, you have a margin of safety and can apply a CAPE ratio to the stock to get to the intrinsic value.
- The problem is that the market might never recognize the mispricing, and the stock could fall even more. Therefore, apart from finding value in stocks, an investor has to also look for catalysts that are going to unlock that value.
- it is extremely important to see what the middle management is doing because for them a $100 thousand or even $50 thousand purchase is very meaningful while if a CEO spends 10% of his salary on purchasing stocks it might not mean much.

- Nevertheless, owning stocks of companies that have the potential to be taken over at a significant premium to the current price is always a plus that is often completely free.
- In order to be categorized as a small cap value stock, a company has to have a market capitalization below $2.5 billion and its stock price has to trade below its book value (where possible, or have the lowest book value).
- International money outflows can create huge pressure on a smaller stock market, especially if the financial markets aren’t that deep. Similarly, inflows can create huge booms.
- A good start at looking for bargains is to use the country’s CAPE ratio which is usually available at starcapital.de.
- Take advantage of sector cyclicality
  The second place to look for bargains are sectors.
- I had to look for companies that have volatile revenues and consequently volatile stock prices but stable business and a strong brand that creates value over the long term.
- Further, something that is relatively easy with commodities is determining the future supply and demand and taking advantage of the usual cyclicality. High commodity prices lead to overinvestments that lead to higher supply and a collapse in prices. Consequently, lower prices limit new investments and sooner or later to a supply gap that often makes prices sky-rocket.
- The safest option to look for when buying into a downward cycle is to find a company that has the lowest production costs and low debt.
- Hyperbolic discounting describes the tendency people have to prefer a smaller reward that will come sooner rather than a larger reward that can come later.
- the value a company will create in the future is discounted at a much higher discount rate than the value it will create in the short term.
- When a growth company doesn’t meet the enormous growth expectations the market has placed on it but is still growing at a healthier pace, it is usually a time when a value investor can get the best of both worlds, growth and value.
- The provision for pensions account shows the unfunded part of a company’s future pension obligations. The provisions are derived by comparing the fair value of the assets owned in the respective pension fund with the present value of the expected future liabilities.
- The best approach to measuring intrinsic value is by using the three components method: past value, earnings value and return on invested capital.
- A great way to analyze the management is to go and read an old annual report or to find an old investor presentation which can be found on the company’s investor relation site.

- The important thing when looking at catalysts is to find investments where what can go wrong is limited, while the positive side is unlimited.
- the Daimler Group has a Performance Phantom Share Plan (PPSP) outstanding (page 255 of 2016 annual report) where the management is compensated in cash, not shares.
- The liabilities are also fair as the pension liability discount rate used is extremely low.
