- instruction includes an operations code (usually abbreviated to ‘OP code’) that acts as a unique identifier so that the processor recognises it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hth933hhc6bw95mk7vsjc9kt))
- increasingly the processor chip itself might have an integrated graphic processing unit (GPU) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htfxk9w1mxtj1g82h48zjt69))
- processor compares the OP code to the list of instructions it understands ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hth942g8gcvwcem42d9ys0bz))

- Such a computer is said to exhibit Turing completeness ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hthf8t4khc7yk1zx4ndq85wh))
- The instruction set as a ‘contract’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hthfa181y0etb79qwzd4khb0))
- set is more than just the collection of instructions that a particular processor can carry out ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hthfay43za6br5kfkve3p6re))
- an instruction set provides a well-defined hardware/software interface ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hthfd86a2tjvpg610w06f2bj))
- the level of abstraction is such that it does not give any details about *how* the operations are implemented ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hthfe47n584gd8dk5pv5fcx2))
#### 3.4.4 RISC and CISC instruction sets
- Reduced instruction set computing (RISC) refers to a system in which the processor can execute a relatively small number of distinct fundamental, highly optimised instructions, each consisting of a single operation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hthw2hq1t93z5qbyz5zqrt4x))
- complex instruction set computing (CISC), the processor can execute many more distinct instructions, with each potentially consisting of many operations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hthw2tb8p0dx3c7db3m41xvh))
- To give you a flavour ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hthw8a0t505wsfbzdpvbyxxp))
- existing circuit that adds two integers and use software to repeatedly execute ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hthw8jzavatrtwx4afym1vqg))
- use a MULTIPLY instruction ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hthw8pne5czwyr90tbv7qvd1))
- other important differences ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hthw9h9z8936q42pwds41hq5))
- Each instruction in a RISC processor can be represented in the same number of bits ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hthwc61ebmvaq3zadrw3jsvx))
- only one memory location is involved ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hthwcj9ad713gfn59dg65t9q))
- CISC instructions are more likely to need variable numbers of bits ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hthwcvn57ykxp6tc0hjqnea0))

- the general trend has been away from CISC towards RISC ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj18jenks6584tamb2vhcz7))
- most processors now take a RISC approach ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj18y0r1rxaf0fr5y41nst0))
- As software developed and main memory became much cheaper, RISC moved into the ascendancy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj19xqyfvp725h98th8j3br))
- the most important advantage that RISC architectures have is the predictability of the representation of an instruction, and the time it takes to execute (one clock cycle) lends itself to pipelining, which is the process of speeding up a task by splitting it into steps that can be executed in parallel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj1adg8hcph3a4mer3fry0s))
##### Pipelining
- do as much as possible in parallel ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj1j2a1kktvzpyg1k3k8jkj))
- the pipeline is most efficient when each part of the process takes the same amount of time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj1m7wc8tfgw2mezkctgqzz))
- in a CISC processor, where some instructions take several clock cycles, whilst others take just one clock cycle, pipelining is less efficient ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj1ptpn2tztd35ndgqgj3pt))
### 3.5 Programmers, programming and programs

- the instructions in the original program (called the source code) need to be converted ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj2ma519fga7fc80y56q9ne))
- in assembly language, the program that does this translation into machine code is called an assembler ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj2n598bcs03875c3ptyfw4))
- each processor family has a different machine language ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj2tnz449bxqz3hkq26jdp7))

##### Interpreting using a virtual machine
- Both machine code and assembly language are examples of low-level programming ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj55617erzkbqcwhyns2kjp))
- When some high-level programming languages ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj90d0jvv2s1jft19awnsve))
- each instruction in the program results in one instruction being executed by the processor. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj55d16f6zj5xqscykb3nyc))
- are compiled, the source code is not translated into the machine code of the processor, but rather into an intermediate stage called bytecode ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj90kjbhwj0rz1k80t25a6c))
- source code (which has an extension of .py) is compiled into bytecode ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj9gdn6ctrxxjmr6b60q9dc))
- loaded into a Python virtual machine (PVM) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj9gprmkj7zqv89zh5bnjwb))
#### 3.5.2 High-level programming languages
- a virtual machine is a layer of software within the operating system that simulates a processor – one that understands bytecode instructions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj95zz9jvtp74m0c161a9am))
- converts the bytecode ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj96ha9zrcv5mf6wyadm4bw))
- each instruction in the high-level language is translated into many instructions in the machine language ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj5ahpy3cyr2s4bspnzj81k))
- then handed on to the host’s operating system, which then interacts with the hardware processor ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj97cra698ym8bsycjp06qw))
- the virtual machine provides a layer of abstraction ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj97j15ag19cdpvrv533q26))
- Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Smalltalk, Scratch ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj5awk0sc7twe5pdvncnqh2))
- bytecode does not need to know any details about how it will eventually be physically executed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj9fh8qen1hy2n977mzk074))
##### Translating a high-level language
- high-level programming languages that used structures more amenable to humans, knowing that they could use the computer itself to translate them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj5d99bj85nn5xb2etkvcr4))
##### The advantages and disadvantages of interpreting using a virtual machine
- advantages ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj9pfhsjygpk5h554v3q9wj))
- the bytecode) exists, it can be run on any computer that has an appropriate virtual machine installed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj9q653gthek73h84b677yw))
- everal ways in which this translation process is carried out, but they all rely on two fundamental processes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj5djz3ds8ydvcfhj2fcmn0))
- Compilation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj5dsqcafxchetp40pwq4bv))
- described as being highly portable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj9qzg8hj8v147kzfjjp6s5))
- source code or source program, is used as the input to a translator program called a compiler ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj61stjzh32v7ayxe2mmx9s))
- considered to be more secure as the input is code that has already been compiled ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj9tq0w4ds8ts0wh8sbb3yw))
- source code is compiled into the object code ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj6hv4abwkg5xeygdnxkp8y))
- the host operating system is one big step removed from the source code, which is where a virus might be introduced ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj9v9e8w6zqw2derryt8ynk))
- this machine language program that is loaded into memory ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj6jsfbz2pvnnbz6t8jx7hm))
- Virtual machines also have safeguards ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj9vh071c2zr2rzvjf40g74))
- there are also disadvantages ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htja2m0yjytmb8gwtj2dhvh3))
- many of today’s high-level language compilers are written in the language they compile ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj6kqv6r7tjkymmsdf1xq4n))
- each different platform needs a different version of the virtual machine ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htja3604ypw80fwjpfj1bhbt))
- A particular programming language will typically have several different compilers to allow for the fact that different families of processors have different versions of machine language, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj6n6a765g34nh3w2x3mqhk))
- program running on a virtual machine also tends to be executed more slowly ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htja63dd0sdj4wbff5k3t13q))
- the bytecode instructions cannot be optimised for any particular processor or platform ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htja6rc6qkww58n215cm052d))
- somewhat mitigated if the virtual machine employs a technique called just-in-time (JIT) compilation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htja76espedews6hc8sfckvs))
- if a block of code is used frequently, the virtual machine compiles it to machine code and stores it in the cache. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htja83eqkzmbcy8qcn6tpnty))
- every change to the source code requires the code to be re-compiled to generate a new machine language representation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj6r1qngfd70f5mh94sbwkt))
##### Virtualisation
- term used to describe any configuration where a physical computer system is emulated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htjt7p9yh3thmmwcb2g32t2n))
- When you buy computer software, you are usually buying the object code, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj6rg8emqxw3d5rgmpk1f13))

- Interpretation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj5dpyxsrjad1m51f5mbqv5))
- an interpreter translates each instruction in the source code only when it is required ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj71j4gc27gwty6qge5q3ns))
- Cloud computing (which is the topic of Block 2 Part 1) relies on virtual machines ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htjt9vtv9fcmngc9s7kk2zbt))
- no object code program is generated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj7358wxhdkprs847vqqz1g))
- capacity to be shared between several users by using a software layer called a hypervisor ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htjt949ewh9vxy0e2kfp2w5z))
- the potentially lengthy process of compilation does not need to be gone through for each small change in the source code ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj73qs09trm3ddxpf00m6p8))
- lend themselves to situations where small incremental changes to a program are being made ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj74j9qaxwby2h951xewcxy))
- The main disadvantage is that the translation process must take place every time a program is executed, resulting in a slower execution of the program. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj75dg5s4g2rythxcygpq0a))
- each processor family needs a different interpreter ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htj75ne7fyyv0m8pze8njhgv))
