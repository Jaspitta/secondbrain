  WHAT'S A SAFE HAVEN?
  Everyone has some intuitive understanding about what a safe haven is and why we would invest in one. Most likely, it would go something like “a place of refuge for when things go bad” or, more specifically, “an asset that provides safety from risk.” These are spot on. The term risk would likely mean scary things like stock market crashes, financial and banking crises, pandemics, monsters hiding under the bed, and so forth. Risk, then, is circularly defined as that equivocal thing we need safety from
- Risk mitigation can and should be thought of as being additive to portfolios over time
- So safe haven investing is risk mitigation
- The Dao of Capital
- You see, a cost‐effective safe haven doesn't just slash risk. It actually lets you simultaneously take more risk
- Principle number one is that investing is a process that happens sequentially through time
- Principle number two is that there is only one explicit purpose or goal of investing, and that is to maximize our wealth over time
- principle number three: If a risk‐mitigation strategy achieves its purpose by cost‐effectively lowering a portfolio's risk, then adding that strategy raises the portfolio's CAGR over time
- “At war with luck”—using our “skills to minimize luck as much as possible”—does indeed apply to risk mitigation. That is precisely how this war is fought in investing. In my case, it is no less than everything I do as an investor. So it is fitting that we begin to understand risk mitigation by deductively stripping it down to its bare bones, literally.
- If you think about it, cost‐effective risk mitigation—or raising compound growth rates and thus wealth through lower risk—is really our comprehensive goal as investors
- water‐diamond paradox: Why do diamonds fetch more in the market than water, even though the latter is essential to life? The value of something is relative to what we already have of it. Generally speaking, people have access to more units of water than they need to satisfy their diverse uses for it; thus, “on the margin,” water has a very low market value. But if you were dying of thirst in the desert, you would certainly give a diamond for a glass of water
- To look at this in terms of the geometric average of the potential outcomes, just as Bernoulli did, we can look at the case where the merchant abstains from insuring himself, and compare that to his insured case where he is guaranteed a fortune of 3,000 rubles plus the 10,000 ruble proceeds (either from selling his commodities or from the insurance underwriter) less the 800 ruble insurance premium, which is 3,000 + 9,200 = 12,200 rubles. On the other hand, without insurance, his geometric average fortune would be 3,000 rubles plus 10,000 rubles in proceeds on 95 trips, and on 5 trips he would only have his original 3,000 rubles (10,000 rubles in commodities lost to Captain Jack). We thus get a Bernoullian geometric expected value, like in the Petersburg wager, of:
  Strangely, the insurance contract is not a zero‐sum game. The merchant has a geometric expected value gain (from 12,081 rubles to 12,200 rubles, or +119 rubles per shipment) and the insurance underwriter has an actuarial arithmetic expected value gain (of 300 rubles per shipment). Thus, the granting of the insurance contract represents a gain (measured in their own frameworks) for both the merchant and the insurer—it's a[…]
- Let's say for the merchant's next 100 shipments, 5 of them are total losses (exactly as expected). In that case, his geometric average total return—or more familiar compound growth rate—per shipment over those 100 shipments would be:
  And, sure enough, his starting capital of 11,000 rubles times 1.098 equals 12,081 rubles, his geometric expected wealth after just one shipment
- This is the rule that it is advisable to divide goods which are exposed to some danger into several portions rather than to risk them all together
- The total return ratio is simply the ending wealth divided by the beginning wealth, or one plus the return on the starting wealth, which produced the ending wealth.
- An Insidious Wealth Tax: The Greater the Loss, the Greater the Profit Needed to Get Back to Even
- He can expect to parlay his wealth at the rate of 9.8% per shipment without insurance—with a lot of risk. With insurance, he will parlay his wealth at the rate of 12,200/11,000 = 1.11, or 11% per shipment—and he will achieve this higher rate of return with no risk.
- This is where the geometric average has real economic meaning: It isn't just the wager on this cargo that drives the value. It is the iterative, multiplicative impact of that result on the next wager, and on the next! A large loss disproportionately lowers our merchant's geometric average return, because it leaves him with a much lower stake, or capital base, to reinvest and compound on his next shipment. The logarithmic loss shows the true (higher) value‐added for him when he insures against it.
- To get what's going on, we need to experience our returns through the lens of the logarithmic function. In other words, geometrically.
- We experience profits and losses and all accounting ledgers arithmetically; we experience life arithmetically—one thing after another. This is linear thinking versus geometric thinking. It's a big difference and essential to our understanding of risk and the disastrous impact of losses on wealth. But it is highly counterintuitive
- Your raw, linear returns are a lie; your true returns are crooked.
- If true, prospect theory can explain why, at least in investing, people generally do not do what Bernoulli prescribes—as they don't have his prescribed objective function—and why people seem to stubbornly ignore the risks that matter
- It shows us what matters to compounding. It is a risk‐enforcer and focuses the mind on which risks move the needle and which do not
- By formulating the logarithmic function as our objective function—as the most effective way to value risky gambles—Bernoulli inadvertently revealed the geometric average as the optimal criterion for valuing those risky gambles. Arithmetic returns are false hopes; the truth lies in geometric returns
- Because the logarithm is a concave function that curves downward, it increasingly penalizes negative raw returns the more negative they are. The steeper the losses, the disproportionately larger the damage they inflict—far greater than profits of the same size can overcome
- Profit is finite. Risk is infinite. You need to avoid plunging down the logarithmic Bernoulli Falls! This is, by far, the most important concept in safe haven investing—nay, of all investing.
- There is so much muddled, superficial narrative in the investment industry. So much movement, so little action
- in favor instead of quantitative meaning and accepts bad results all in the name of safety from bad results. Fate loves irony.
- and we must live with our results “once more and innumerable times more,” do you really want to keep on ignoring the same bad outcomes over and over for eternity?
- In infinite time, every possible combination would at some time be realized; even more, it would be realized an infinite number of times.” Since this implies that we aren't just repeating one path, but all paths, Nietzsche's proof here loses some of its punch, but it deserves props for effort.
- The ability to answer “yes” to the prospect of experiencing the same investment return as an eternal return is a most powerful force and focuses the mind. It should change the way you invest by changing your internal valuation metric: that is, the value of getting this path right eclipses the value of getting the expected path right.
- This means optimizing risk by investing in a way that, whatever happens, we can declare, as Nietzsche exhorts, “Thus I willed it!”
- You Get What You Get, Not What You Expect
  You will traverse only one of these paths. Better pick a good one!
- your probability of ending up with 19,000 times your starting wealth or greater is a mere 0.5%
- Here's the geometric progression of those expected 50 rolls landing on each side of the die:
  This logic seems to imply that you will be left with an ending wealth of essentially zero
- or the geometric average across just one roll's six possible returns:
- With Nietzsche's demon (who annoyingly reflects what happens in the real world), you are not likely to get a very good eternally recurring fate. Multiplicative compounding looks more like a most destructive force in the universe
- Recall from the previous chapter that the geometric average of the 300 returns in this geometric progression is just the 300th root of their product, or 0.0101/300 = 0.985, or a –1.5% compound growth rate.
- This is more evidence that the expected geometric average return of a single wager gives you the same expected geometric average return as valuing it as an eternally compounding wager—regardless of what you actually plan to do. This is the cool, intuitive shortcut of Bernoulli's logarithmic objective function
- the value right in the middle from playing the game, across the multiverse of all possible ending wealth outcomes
- The most intuitive way for us to think about the
- meaning of the expected geometric average return and, equivalently, the geometric average ending wealth outcome under multiplicative growth (like our dice game) is simply as the expected median ending wealth outcome
- The median ending wealth, the expected log of ending wealth, and the median and expected growth rate all correspond to the same thing.
- Let's say that, instead of always going all‐in on each roll, you only bet 40% of your total remaining cash on each roll. You keep the remaining 60% on the sidelines earning nothing, and this means that you are cutting by 60% your previous 3.3% expected average return each roll. On the following page is a diagram of this new risk‐mitigated payoff profile.
  Xs and Os Profile: The Kelly Criterion
- From our previous experience, it seemed as if playing this dice game was a bad idea, at least according to the rules of Nietzsche's demon. But now it
- looks like we're saying it's a great game to play, so long as you only risk a portion of your wealth each roll. What gives?
- All three of our triad, Bernoulli, Kelly, and Latané, had their own spin—as well as those who have carried it on. But each points to the very same geometric mean maximizing criterion of our Petersburg merchant trade
- in other words lessening the pain of bad contingencies (the pain of the concavity of curve) in a way that raises the median contingency. Under multiplicative dynamics, it's really hard to recover from big losses
- There are really two contrary forces acting on our distribution of outcomes: a visible one lowering it—the arithmetic cost—and a hidden one raising it—the geometric effect. When the latter is greater than the former as it is here, the result is a positive net portfolio effect and cost‐effective risk mitigation. The tension between these two often hidden forces is at the very
- heart of safe haven investing
- is that Kelly's system of keeping (in this case) 60% of your total wealth in reserve is the equivalent of allocating 60% of your total wealth to a safe haven. With each roll, that cash just sits there earning zero interest (and presumably losing no real value from inflation); it remains available to use, if you so desire, on the next roll. All it does is hold its value in order to cushion a loss from the game. It is what we will refer to as a “store‐of‐value” safe haven
- It doesn't take much set aside for the insurance. It's like a pinch of salt—just a pinch becomes the most important ingredient to the dish, whereas more than a pinch ruins it.
- This double whammy of arithmetic cost savings plus greater net portfolio effect is what's referred to as an economically dominant strategy—and the cost saving actually helps lead to the net effect.
- the 50% losses from rolling a 1 have been
- mitigated, at the expense of a 9% cost for all other rolls
- insurance is most certainly not a zero‐sum game
- Perhaps Bernoulli should have instead described the logarithmic concavity of curve of his objective function as
- nature's admonition to either avoid or insure the dice.
- you have seen how the multiplicative
- dynamics of gains and losses, compounding one after the other, bring you to your wealth at any moment; and you have seen how changes in those dynamics through risk mitigation can impact the expected growth rate of that compounding
- Our aim as investors is to maximize the rate at which we
- compound our wealth over time on our one and only realized outcome
- Put simply, we need a risk‐mitigation strategy that makes our returns both more accurate and more precise, to win the bloody “war with luck.”
- As we will see in Part Two, in the real world, when cost‐effective safe havens like these actually exist—if they do at all—they fall somewhere along this spectrum. And depending on where they fall, they can be very different from each other in their cost‐effectiveness
- You have seen it in two basic safe haven strategies: the store‐of‐value safe haven (or Kelly‐optimal strategy) and the insurance safe haven
- Think of our previous definition as a payoff that mitigates risk or the bad potential economic contingencies in a portfolio; as such, a cost‐effective safe haven is one that, in addition, raises wealth over time
- The point of trying to classify things into “natural kinds” is to make generalizations according to characteristic properties that they all share, and which are “necessary and sufficient” to be a member of a kind.
- fixed—like Plato's unchanging essences, and as many did when considering species before Darwin—is to naïvely succumb to the retrospective safe haven fallacy
- Further confounding the problem, our classifications are a moving target. Essential safe haven features may emerge at one point in time, and later vanish, just as biological traits can change with time. Treating them like they are
- created equal. Indeed, not all safe havens are even safe havens—and certainly very few, if any, are cost‐effective
- A Taxonomy of the Three Prototypical Safe Havens
  This taxonomy of safe haven varieties represents the full spectrum of safe haven payoffs that we can expect to see in the far messier real world—typically as hybrids between these different varieties
- The store‐of‐value payoff is essentially meant to be somewhat fixed in time and space, like an annuity or even an unproductive real asset
- The alpha payoff is like the store‐of‐value, only its correlation is now expected to
- be negative
- the insurance payoff, is a much more extreme case of the alpha payoff. The insurance safe haven specifically needs to make a large profit in a crash, relative to its small expected losses the rest of the time
- Three Cartoon Safe Haven Prototype Payoff Profiles (by Simultaneous SPX returns)
- A tactical safe haven, on the other hand, is about mitigating systematic risk in a portfolio by periodically and actively moving in and out of certain “safe” allocations, with the well‐intentioned purpose of saving on the high cost of that safety when times are good
- But this is an internal contradiction. Cost‐effective risk mitigation can never require a magic crystal ball.
- Risk mitigation needs to be a sustained way of life or habit, not a transient state
- A Taxonomy of the Three Prototypical Safe Haven Imposters
- If a lot of luck is required for a safe haven to do its job controlling risk, that means more risk, not less
- call this the prospective safe haven fallacy, and
- Victor Niederhoffer, there are “ever‐changing cycles
- diworsification. The thinking goes like this: Fill your portfolio with things that don't all move around together and, as a result, your portfolio will move around less
- But so, too, will your returns, as this diversification comes at a pretty price
- Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are
- doing
- To add insult to injury, I would add that diversification is a confession that you don't care about cost‐effectiveness in your risk mitigation. You just want less risk, no matter the cost
- True risk mitigation should not require financial engineering and leverage in order to both lower risk and raise compound annual growth rates
- 10,000 Paths of 25‐year Compounded SPX Returns, by Rolling a d120 Die
  Naturally
- as we go about combining them with various safe haven payoffs to see what happens next.
  And what happens next is where things get interesting.
- INDUCTIVE DICE
- Frequency Distribution of SPX Annual Returns, 1901–2020
- Notice that over the past 120 years there have been 11 SPX annual returns of –15% or lower. And so it turns out that our tenbagger insurance cartoon payoff would have just
- broken even, on a standalone basis—or a 0% arithmetic average return—over that period. And the standalone alpha cartoon payoff would have made a +7% arithmetic average return per year over that same period
- There were what are called emergent properties that do not exist in the individual components. These properties are only apparent when viewed holistically as a whole.
  Emergent behavior arises in many well‐known systems where interacting individual parts create complex, unpredictable, and irreducible behavior
- And the same is very true of safe haven investing
- the whole is not the same as the sum of its parts.” Aristotle's words, above all others, are our risk‐mitigation creed
- Modern finance says to take these individual parts of a portfolio—understand and place a value on each of their individual expected arithmetic returns, volatilities, and covariances with each other—then combine them all within a box; and then the whole of that box is well understood by the sum of their arithmetic returns
- the reason the safe havens can add so much ending wealth to the game is due to the iterative nature of the game. They provide capital for the next dice roll by resetting or rebalancing the size of the wager at the end of each roll
- They actually transform the dice game—preventing a plunge in the size of any subsequent wager. The wagers now interact, rather than act independently, as they are no longer ring‐fenced from each other. Thus, an entirely new whole is formed—one that is very different from the sum of its parts. This is what's known as strong emergence.
- This is investing's own theory of relativity: There is no single value that we can assign to an investment, specifically a risk‐mitigation investment. Rather, its value is unique or relative to the observer, or to the larger perspective of the
- observer's whole portfolio—specifically how it interacts with the multiplicative dynamics of that portfolio
- If we only look at the one way that things happened and obsess over it as the only likely outcome—in other words, if we over‐extrapolate the past— then we are engaged in something called naïve empiricism
- We've taken pains to create an experiment whereby we can test, side by side, what would happen to an all‐SPX portfolio and also SPX‐plus‐safe‐haven cartoon portfolios, based on the range of returns of the SPX over the past 120 years. Got it? Here we go
- This, then, is the relative score for each of our risk‐mitigated portfolios. The CAGR impact or difference from the SPX (shown as “NET”) determines which risk‐mitigation strategy is the leader on our scoreboard.
  Xs and Os Profiles: Risk‐Mitigation Scoreboard
- Everything in this book up to now has been leading to this point: testing if and how risk mitigation can raise wealth by lowering risk. It's an exciting moment because this is contrary to what we have been taught and what we would have thought.
- The median CAGR of the store‐of‐value portfolio of 9.1% is below that 9.4% rejection boundary. Consequently, we must reject (with 95% confidence) the null hypothesis that the store‐of‐value cartoon payoff is cost‐effective risk mitigation. It doesn't make the cut. Similarly, the alpha portfolio median CAGR of 9.3% is also below that 9.4% rejection boundary; thus, the null hypothesis that the alpha cartoon payoff is cost‐effective risk mitigation must also be rejected
- As we can see, cost‐effective risk mitigation doesn't just slash risk or systematic exposure; it actually lets you take on more exposure (as evidenced by a larger SPX allocation) at the same time.
- We can represent any given risk‐mitigated portfolio as a point on the cost‐effectiveness plane; that point's deviation from the SPX baseline at y = x represents that portfolio's median CAGR outperformance
- The diagonal SPX baseline contains that same 95% confidence interval for the median CAGR of the SPX. The area below the diagonal—or more specifically below the rejection boundary, or lower confidence band on the diagonal—is the rejection region for our null hypothesis tests
- Geometric Effect – Arithmetic Cost = Net Portfolio Effect
- Cost‐effectiveness in risk mitigation should thus be thought of as both an absolute and a relative measure. This will be particularly important to keep in mind should we find that truly absolute cost‐effective safe havens are scarce in the real world. The best need not be the enemy of the good
- The Net Portfolio Effect When Reshuffling
- Because we have torn apart the interacting gears of our safe haven mechanisms (or the coordinated payoff profiles that mitigate a portfolio's big losses), the whole (or the median CAGR) is no longer greater for the insurance cartoon. All that remains is meager diversification
- No‐Crash Bootstrap: Is the Optimal Safe Haven Agnostic to a Crash?
- Any skill in predicting crashes (perceived or otherwise) should not impact the decision between these payoffs
- When employing safe havens tactically by switching between different varieties (such as the store‐of‐value, alpha, and insurance payoffs) in order to save costs while awaiting
- a crash, the least costly choice when there is no crash is the same as the most cost‐effective choice with a crash (that is, the insurance)—thus removing the necessity for tactical skill
- If you really desire to hold something like the SPX on its own, with a 5th percentile CAGR of 2.7% (and you're going to congratulate yourself when your no‐risk mitigation works out well while following a benign path), then you should compare that to our three risk‐mitigated strategies adjusted to lower their 5th percentile CAGR of 4.8% down to 2.7%.
- And when we run the previous bootstrap again (with no SPX returns of –15% or lower) with these new levered SPX allocations, the median CAGRs for the store‐of‐value, alpha, and insurance risk‐mitigated portfolios become 26.9%, 26.9%, and 27.6%, respectively (compared with the similar median CAGR for the SPX alone of 14.3%)
- portfolios, the optimal risk‐mitigation solutions are robust and indifferent to when—and even if—there is ever a crash again. (Fat tails are superfluous.) This is winning the war against luck
- Ironically, when we are honest about apples‐to‐apples comparisons of
- The geometric effect really is the offense.
  In investing, good defense leads to good offense.
- The whole is often, but not always, much greater than the sum of the parts.
  This is a big challenge for most observers. And this is particularly so in investing because the math of the sum—or of arithmetic averaging—is so intuitive, while the math of the whole—or of compounding—is so counterintuitive
- As in many things, our capacity to frame a problem
- coherently and correctly is what creates our capacity to solve it, not to mention our capacity to monetize that solution
- All risk‐mitigation strategies ultimately require a tradeoff between the degree of loss protection provided—the geometric effect, or the amount of the portfolio's negative compounding that is avoided—versus the degree of opportunity cost from allocating capital to that protection rather than to the rest of the portfolio
- breaks a shopkeeper's window, and someone in the assembled crowd then tries to argue that this is actually a good thing, because it means more business for the glazier. As Bastiat points out, the fallacy here is obvious when you consider that we should all then simply go about smashing windows to increase economic activity and growth. The narrow framing of that fallacious view overlooks the implicit cost to the shopkeeper, who must now spend funds to fix his window
- In a thought experiment parable, a mischievous boy
- The shopkeeper's wealth is lowered (relative to what it otherwise would have been, had the boy not smashed the window), while the income in the community is merely rearranged
- We can achieve safety by simply driving slower, or we can achieve safety another way such that we can drive faster.
  The decision ultimately comes down to the cost‐effectiveness tradeoff of the pit stop—between the implicit costs of
- the alternatives. But it never comes down to the explicit cost of what it feels like to be in the pit stop and not moving for those 10 seconds, while watching the competition fly by
- To forget one's purpose is the commonest form of stupidity
- Fuller had this idea that we should think of the Earth as a spaceship, and we are all the crew with finite resources. Ideally, we work synergistically, to raise the whole despite these finite parts. The problem is we are doomed to get so caught up in our own little parts that we cannot conceive of the whole.
- The Great Pirates saw the big picture, recognized the advantage, and worked to keep their competitive advantage. They could see the world's Xs and Os. Fuller called this advantage their “comprehensive thinking” versus everyone else's “localized thinking
- Fuller's Great Pirates were surely more figurative than literal. Perhaps he was just building a paranoid metaphor or moniker around the multidisciplined, big‐picture scientists and artists such as Da Vinci and Michelangelo, whom he called out. It doesn't really matter.
- Those who stayed on top of the waters and prospered did so because of their comprehensive capability
- So, you see why I warned against definitive answers in this book. Definitive answers come from pseudoscientific hucksters.
  All of that said, remember that cost‐effectiveness analysis doesn't have to be all about absolute cost‐effectiveness. It can be about relative cost‐effectiveness just as well. We can adjust our SPX baseline such that we have less stringent thresholds for rejection.
- In our contest, too, the winners have proven their mettle historically, having been severely tested. But this contest has no victory celebration, no crowning with laurels. It must be seen as always ongoing. Every new return is another lap that continues the race. Without
- a finish line, the leaderboard is always provisional.
- Our null hypothesis, just as with our cartoon safe havens in the last chapter, is that lowering risk in a portfolio with a certain real‐world safe haven produces, as a consequence, higher wealth. And recall that, by higher wealth, in the context of our bootstrap methodology, we mean higher geometric average ending wealth or, equivalently, higher median ending wealth or CAGR (after 25 years); and by lowering risk, we mean raising that portfolio's 5th percentile ending wealth or CAGR
- effectiveness. It can be worse than nothing even.
  A Warped Payoff: 20‐Year Treasury Bonds
- The best example of cash is certainly the three‐month US Treasury bill. Its short duration means no interest rate risk beyond the reinvestment risk, as we can simply reinvest that allocation three times for each of our annual data points
- Xs and Os Profile: Three‐month US Treasury Bills
- Thus, our null hypothesis that the three‐month Treasury bill is a cost‐effective safe haven must be rejected, as we deny its consequent: that adding the three‐month Treasury bill to our SPX portfolio raises that portfolio's CAGR over
- time (and which we've just seen, it doesn't).
- Xs and Os Profiles: US Treasuries
- This time, they look a bit better than the three‐month bill, though there is still either no or only marginal cost‐effectiveness from these 10‐year and 20‐year Treasuries as safe havens. In addition to the negative net portfolio effect of the three‐month Treasury (–1.8%), the 10‐year Treasury note (–0.4%) and 20‐year bond (–0.1%) are also drags on portfolio performance
- similarly enormous variability in the shape of the payoff. Either the bond's payoff profile is just extremely noisy from moment to moment and decade to decade, or something is acting on it to warp it. Is it an unseen Neptune, that perhaps we can discover and use tactically, or is it a Vulcan, meaning a presumption that leads us to the wrong conclusion? If it's a Vulcan effect, the 20‐year Treasury bond is essentially what we earlier described in our taxonomy as a hopeful haven—with so much noise that the payoff loses much of its meaning and economic
- As we move from one interval of time to the next, we see a lot of variability in the net portfolio effect of the 20‐year Treasury bond, from –0.8% to +0.6% to –0.9%. And this is using the same d120 distribution of SPX returns. And what's driving this is
- Neptune or Vulcan—Treasuries look an awful lot like a hopeful haven or a diworsifier haven.
- returns, with a maxed‐out 50% allocation within the SPX portfolio):
  Xs and Os Profile: CTAs
- Here is our Xs and Os payoff profile of an index of CTA
- And just like the alpha cartoon, the CTA's degree of downside protection is insufficient to provide cost‐effective risk mitigation. (What's more, it is even insufficient to raise the portfolio's 5 th percentile CAGR to 4.8%
- Of course, gold is perhaps first and foremost thought of as a hedge against inflation.
  However, it's actually a very noisy hedge against inflation. It is mostly (even almost entirely) tied to movements in real interest rates
- Here is the Xs and Os payoff profile of gold (with a 20% allocation to an SPX portfolio):
  Xs and Os Profile: Gold
- Consequently, the net portfolio effect of gold is positive (+0.3%). So, in the case of gold, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that it is cost‐effective as a safe haven
- Another Warped Payoff: Gold
- But cryptocurrency enthusiasts have their heads in the right place. Cryptocurrencies are thought of as insurance policies against the failure of central bankers. This, by extension, has also given them the presumed role of being an insurance policy against economic crises—since, at this point, that would entail the failure of current monetary policy.
- Moreover, bitcoin isn't even ultimately anonymous; the technical term is that it's pseudonymous, meaning that
- the owner of each bitcoin is public knowledge at any moment, although it's not obvious which human is tied to each address. But it's quite traceable, nonetheless
- Universa's realized standalone safe haven payoff profile has been much more explosive than a tenbagger, and this has resulted in our cost‐effectiveness as a risk mitigation strategy
- People think of risk mitigation as a tradeoff against wealth creation, because it usually is. It shouldn't be
- The net portfolio effect—or the cost‐effectiveness of a safe haven—is thus driven by how little of that safe haven is needed for a given level of risk mitigation. When little is needed, it drives down the safe haven's arithmetic average cost relative to its geometric effect. The more the plunge over Bernoulli Falls is mitigated with less cost, the further down this safe haven frontier we travel—and the greater the cost‐effectiveness.
- There is a beautiful order to this safe haven frontier line: Mitigating the worst paths gets a safe haven onto this highest line—on the frontier; and then mitigating those worst paths with less cost is what slides that safe haven to the left along that frontier line. The ability to raise that 5 th percentile path—to be more precise in our William Tell shot—with less cost, in turn raises the median path—the accuracy of our shot
- There exists a real and meaningful safe haven frontier that we can use; it defines and explains the edge of the envelope along which we can push
- The groundwork laid in these exercises gets us thinking rigorously and
- constructively about that great dilemma, the most important problem in all of investing, that was the very reason for this book. It got us thinking about and even finding a spectrum of safe havens and the safe haven frontier that can get us to its solution
- You aim high in a way that, even if you don't hit your target, you will also love the other things you're likely to hit instead—your alternative potential outcomes.
  Aim high and aim small; miss high and miss small.
- you control what you can control when taking that one shot; and once the arrow has left your bow, it's out of your control
- But it wasn't his elaborate navigational charts that were his treasure map; rather, it was Bernoulli's logarithmic map
- Rather, to Nietzsche, amor fati was tweaking your payoff from those rolls of the dice such that you will love whatever you get.
  To love any fate, however the die lands, is not
- resignation. No, this is a call to alter that fate—not the die itself, but its effect—such that we can declare, “Thus I willed it!
- And let's always remember that great twist of safe haven investing, that a cost‐effective safe haven is not about slashing risk. To the contrary, we mitigate risk
- deliberately so that we can do more, not do less
- In its essence, the cost‐effective safe haven would seem to need to fold up neatly out of the way and forgotten, like an umbrella in hand, ready to deploy at a moment's notice—a shelter from the sudden storm.
  Weather and market predictions being what
- they are, our umbrella allows us to accept—and even love—whatever sides of the weather and market gods’ dice come up. Like Schrödinger's cat and a splintered die, we can be both safely under cover in the rain and under sunny skies, at the same time
- For us, it means that our safe haven should let us forget that it is even there. It should let us go about
- our business, rain or shine, no matter what financial storms loom, allowing us to safely enjoy what remains of a beautiful day. It should allow us to weather any storm—including, just as importantly, none at all
