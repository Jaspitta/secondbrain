## Highlights
- if we seek Plato’s philosopher-king in the flesh we could hardly do better than Marcus, ([Location 32](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=32))
- He would have claimed to be, at best, a diligent student and a very imperfect practitioner ([Location 34](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=34))
- But literature served only as a preparation for the real goal. This was rhetoric, ([Location 49](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=49))
- The Senate expected deference in public and hoped for influence behind the scenes; “good” emperors were willing to play along. ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=112))
- Another area where Marcus’s policy continued that of his predecessors related to a small and eccentric sect known as the Christians. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=116))
- Their “atheism”—their refusal to accept any god but their own—endangered ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=121))
- According to this theory, man is like a dog tied to a moving wagon. If the dog ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=222))
- refuses to run along with the wagon he will be dragged by it, yet the choice remains his: to run or be dragged. ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=223))
- When Marcus refers, as he does on a number of occasions, to “cause and material” he means the two elements of these compounds—inert substance and animating pneuma—which are united so long as the object itself exists. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=232))
- Stoicism has even been described, not altogether unfairly, as the real religion of upper-class Romans. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=257))
- It aimed to embrace all knowledge, and its focus was speculative and theoretical. Roman Stoicism, by contrast, was a practical discipline—not an abstract system of thought, but an attitude to life. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=260))
- It is, in other words, not objects and events but the interpretations we place on them that are the problem. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=328))
- All human beings possess not only a share of the logos but also the ability to use it (that is what makes us human and distinguishes us from other animals). ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=332))
- In our relationships with others we must work for their collective good, while treating them justly and fairly as individuals. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=339))
- All human beings have a share of the logos, and all have roles to play in the vast design that is the world. But this is not to say that all humans are equal or that the roles they are assigned are interchangeable. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=341))
- Our duty to act justly does not mean that we must treat others as our equals; it means that we must treat them as they deserve. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=345))
- For if we recognize that all events have been foreseen by the logos and form part of its plan, and that the plan in question is unfailingly good (as it must be), then it follows that we must accept whatever fate has in store for us, ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=358))
- Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option: to accept this event with humility [will]; to treat this person as he should be treated [action]; to approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in [perception]. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=365))
- “They are like this,” Marcus says of other people, “because they can’t tell good from evil” ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=394))
- They are “spiritual exercises” composed to provide a momentary stay against the stress and confusion of everyday life: ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=477))
- “Soon you will be dead,” Marcus tells himself on a number of occasions, “and none of it will matter” ([Location 557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=557))
- If Marcus contemplates the stars, he does so only in order to “wash off the mud of life below” ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=603))
- The human body itself is no more than “rotting meat in a bag” ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=606))
- “reading the Meditations for long periods can be conducive of melancholy.” ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=609))
- Marcus does not offer us a means of achieving happiness, but only a means of resisting pain. ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=613))
- From a Stoic perspective, of course, “God” or “the gods” (the terms are used interchangeably by many ancient writers) are merely conventional terms for what we might equally well call “nature” or “the logos” or “Providence,” or simply “how things are.” ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=619))
- The only complete manuscript to survive is a fourteenth-century codex (now in the Vatican), which is riddled with errors. ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=658))
- and to pay attention to nothing, no matter how fleetingly, except the logos. And to be the same in all circumstances—intense pain, the loss of a child, chronic illness. ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=827))
- They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=925))
- We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=927))
- Stop allowing your mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfish impulses, to kick against fate and the present, and to mistrust the future. ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=932))
- Theophrastus is right, and philosophically sound, to say that the sin committed out of pleasure deserves a harsher rebuke than the one committed out of pain. The angry man is more like a victim of wrongdoing, provoked by pain ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=958))
- You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think. If the gods exist, then to abandon human beings is not frightening; the gods would never subject you to harm. And if they don’t exist, or don’t care what happens to us, what would be the point of living in a world without gods or Providence? ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=961))
- The present is all that they can give up, since that is all you have, and what you do not have, you cannot lose. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=987))
- Sum Up: The body and its parts are a river, the soul a dream and mist, life is warfare and a journey far from home, lasting reputation is oblivion. Then what can guide us? Only philosophy. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1000))
- If all the rest is common coin, then what is unique to the good man? To welcome with affection what is sent by fate. ([Location 1109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1109))
- “If you seek tranquillity, do less.” Or (more accurately) do what’s essential—what the logos of a social being requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better. Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, “Is this necessary?” ([Location 1193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1193))
- Or to put it another way: It needs to realize that what happens to everyone—bad and good alike—is neither good nor bad. That what happens in every life—lived naturally or not—is neither natural nor unnatural. ([Location 1238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1238))
- Suppose that a god announced that you were going to die tomorrow “or the day after.” Unless you were a complete coward you wouldn’t kick up a fuss about which day it was—what difference could it make? Now recognize that the difference between years from now and tomorrow is just as small. ([Location 1254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1254))
- Human lives are brief and trivial. ([Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1262))
- Why treat the one as a misfortune rather than the other as fortunate? Can you really call something a misfortune that doesn’t violate human nature? ([Location 1268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1268))
- So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune. ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1272))
- the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?” ([Location 1284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1284))
- —But it’s nicer here.… So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? ([Location 1285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1285))
- —But we have to sleep sometime.… Agreed. But nature set a limit on that—as it did on eating and drinking. And you’re over the limit. You’ve had more than enough of that. But not of working. ([Location 1288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1288))
- And some aren’t, but they’re still aware of it—still regard it as a debt. But others don’t even do that. They’re like a vine that produces grapes without looking for anything in return. A horse at the end of the race … A dog when the hunt is over … A bee with its honey stored … And a human being after helping others. ([Location 1310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1310))
- They don’t make a fuss about it. They just go on to something else, as the vine looks forward to bearing fruit again in season. We should be like that. Acting almost unconsciously. ([Location 1313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1313))
- And in that case, let’s accept it—as we accept what the doctor prescribes. It may not always be pleasant, but we embrace it—because we want to get well. Look at ([Location 1328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1328))
- the accomplishment of nature’s plans in that light—the ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1329))
- Things gravitate toward what they were intended for. ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1378))
- Nothing happens to anyone that he can’t endure. The same thing happens to other people, and they weather it unharmed—out ([Location 1385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1385))
- The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way. ([Location 1392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1392))
- So other people hurt me? That’s their problem. Their character and actions are not mine. What is done to me is ordained by nature, what I do by my own. ([Location 1404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1404))
- The mind is the ruler of the soul. It should remain unstirred by agitations of the flesh—gentle and violent ones alike. ([Location 1405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1405))
- I was once a fortunate man but at some point fortune abandoned me. But true good fortune is what you make for yourself. Good fortune: good character, good intentions, and good actions. ([Location 1446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1446))
- You take things you don’t control and define them as “good” or “bad.” And so of course when the “bad” things happen, or the “good” ones don’t, you blame the gods and feel hatred for the people responsible—or those you decide to make responsible. Much of ([Location 1570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1570))
- our bad behavior stems from trying to apply those criteria. If we limited “good” and “bad” to our own actions, we’d have no call to challenge God, or to treat other people as enemies. ([Location 1572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1572))
- If the gods have made decisions about me and the things that happen to me, then they were good decisions. (It’s hard to picture a god who makes bad ones.) And why would they expend their energies on causing me harm? What good would it do them—or the world, which is their primary concern? ([Location 1581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1581))
- if they decide nothing about our lives … well, I can still make decisions. ([Location 1586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1586))
- Ambition means tying your well-being to what other people say or do. Self-indulgence means tying it to the things that happen to you. Sanity means tying it to your own actions. ([Location 1612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1612))
- The mind in itself has no needs, except for those it creates itself. Is undisturbed, except for its own disturbances. Knows no obstructions, except those from within. ([Location 1663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1663))
- Frightened of change? But what can exist without it? What’s closer to nature’s heart? Can you take a hot bath and leave the firewood as it was? Eat food without transforming it? Can any vital process take place without something being changed? Can’t you see? It’s just the same with you—and just as vital to nature. ([Location 1667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1667))
- [On pain:] Unendurable pain brings its own end with it. ([Location 1699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1699))
- Chronic pain is always endurable: the intelligence maintains serenity by cutting itself off from the body, the mind remains undiminished. And the parts that pain affects—let them speak for themselves, if they can. ([Location 1699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1699))
- Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option: to accept this event with humility to treat this person as he should be treated to approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in. ([Location 1736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1736))
- lower things exist for the sake of higher ones, and higher things for one another. ([Location 1742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1742))
- Dig deep; the water—goodness—is down there. And as long as you keep digging, it will keep bubbling up. ([Location 1754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1754))
- So that Judgment can look the event in the eye and say, “This is what you really are, regardless of what you may look like.” ([Location 1781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1781))
- It’s silly to try to escape other people’s faults. They are inescapable. Just try to escape your own. ([Location 1788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1788))
- You’ve given aid and they’ve received it. And yet, like an idiot, you keep holding out for more: to be credited with a Good Deed, to be repaid in kind. Why? ([Location 1790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1790))
- When you have to deal with someone, ask yourself: What does he mean ([Location 1835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1835))
- by good and bad? If he thinks x or y about pleasure and pain (and what produces them), about fame and disgrace, about death and life, then it shouldn’t shock or surprise you when he does x or y. In fact, I’ll remind myself that he has no real choice. ([Location 1835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1835))
- Have you ever seen a severed hand or foot, or a decapitated head, just lying somewhere far away from the body it belonged to …? That’s what we do to ourselves—or try to—when we rebel against what happens to ([Location 1884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1884))
- segregate ourselves. Or when we do something selfish. You have torn yourself away from unity—your natural state, one you were born to share in. Now you’ve cut yourself off from it. But you have one advantage here: you can reattach yourself. ([Location 1886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1886))
- Don’t let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole. Don’t try to picture everything bad that could possibly happen. Stick with the situation at hand, and ask, “Why is this so unbearable? Why can’t I endure it?” You’ll be embarrassed to answer. ([Location 1893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1893))
- Nothing that can happen is unusual or unnatural, and there’s no sense in complaining. Nature does not make us endure the unendurable. ([Location 1922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1922))
- External things are not the problem. It’s your assessment of them. Which you can erase right now. If the problem is something in your own character, who’s stopping you from setting your mind straight? ([Location 1924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1924))
- And if it’s that you’re not doing something you think you should be, why not just do it? —But there are insuperable obstacles. Then it’s not a problem. The cause of your inaction lies outside you. —But how can I go on living with that undone? Then depart, with a good conscience, as if you’d done it, embracing the obstacles too. ([Location 1925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC1JAI&location=1925))
