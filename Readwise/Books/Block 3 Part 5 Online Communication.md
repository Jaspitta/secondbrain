- Full Title: Block 3 Part 5 Online Communication
- Category: #books
- Summary: In Block 3 Part 5, the module explores online communication, focusing on asynchronous and synchronous methods. Asynchronous communication like email, discussion forums, and blogs are discussed, highlighting their diverse uses and benefits. The module also delves into online communities, social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, and the challenges and advantages they present. Additionally, synchronous communication technologies such as chat tools, instant messaging, and video conferencing are examined, emphasising the importance of human factors in real-time interactions and the evolving nature of telepresence systems.

## Highlights
### Categories of online communication
- One way of categorising online communication is to think about whether it is asynchronous (independent of time) or synchronous (in real time). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqq7c8eqbmbsswccyq1ap4zp))
- Asynchronous communication is when a message is sent and received at different times, so there is no need for the sender and the recipient to be online at the same time. A module forum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqq7cr1fznbgf7rcg04qckc3))
- synchronous communication occurs in real time, so all participants must be online at the same time, and responses tend to be almost instant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqq7d5t8p99qf22rztv3k7dv))
- One way to think about the difference between asynchronous and synchronous communication is to define an asynchronous tool as one where the contributions are stored on a server, so that they can be accessed at any time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqq7g0b4dfb3kk7jsdqkgrvw))
- Many communication tools can be used either asynchronously or synchronously ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqq7gaze3gef6m6ymghwzcsg))

- Technology aspects ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqwdjdj7amwrthm28w9egm97))
    - Tags: [[.h4]] 
- The technology of videoconferencing is, as you can imagine, quite complex ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqwdkemw6rm3xf3c0hrpsggf))
- achieve as high a quality of video and audio communication as possible, within the limits of the available bandwidth ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqwdkqhfdvx6weyxg04x2ag8))
- connects two or more endpoints. These are the hardware devices, with the required software ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqwdmkf456nm643b86pvkwek))
- video data from each endpoint consists of a series of frames ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqwdn5j9tkh65r4a1afeeqn4))
- Pre-processing software removes data that would not be noticeable to the human visual system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqwdnkw6qf0xea4sra9rvjh9))
- lossy compression ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqwdnt8arszzqm2dspt2bta9))
- Some of the transmitted frames are predictions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqwdrbs0w1466mbj7g1f8zr2))
- The endpoints in a videoconference negotiate a frame rate, to make sure each endpoint is capable of sending/receiving at the final agreed rate. In desktop videoconferencing, the frame rate might be 15 frames per second. In contrast, a standalone videoconferencing system (which typically requires specialised equipment in a specific room) might operate at 30 frames per second. The endpoints also negotiate a data rate; if the bandwidth available to one or both of the endpoints is low, they might need to agree on a relatively low data rate. If a higher rate is possible, this allows for higher-quality video. As an example of the bandwidth requirements, a Skype one-to-one video call needs about 500 kbps in each direction.

- it might be necessary to vary the actual data rate and frame rate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqwe7htmm08aygzzm8vwac16))
- because the available bandwidth and the data transfer requirements may change with time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqwe7qjxesb9ecn1hnf58qnd))
- If there is a significant lag (e.g. more than 150 ms) between sending and receiving the audio/video, the communication system becomes difficult and frustrating to use. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqwe9pr1feecs3xzck1yxr3p))
##### Human factors
- The value of real-time conferencing for communication depends on human factors as well as technical factors ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqwejg7yw2ssvcdrdxgn2z3g))

- researchers have used the term ‘social presence’ to express how ‘warm’ online communication seems to the participants ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqxm2c9cehsxz5p74zxazr7b))
- The degree of social presence that people experience when they are communicating online can be strongly influenced by the type of communication medium they are using ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqxm2wkt5wvg4fhr835fh3n9))
- It is not easy to convey feelings via text, and the delay between messages is also a problem ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqxm3d991v4ex7nbxb8mekv2))
- typically all you have are the words on the screen, so it can be difficult to interpret the tone of the message ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqxmb9jnz4ayjvb6663kdyfh))
- in a videoconference, you can see other people’s body language and expressions, and you can hear their tone of voice ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqxmbqzbs77hzjbm9mkh3vpg))
- Social presence is influenced by how participants use a communication medium, as well as by the medium itself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqxmc93rjg6d0n0tay3m105y))
- People can ‘create’ social presence online by behaving in ways that are perceived as warm or sociable. This can compensate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqxmckx6wz243xd0pcnv6zjg))
