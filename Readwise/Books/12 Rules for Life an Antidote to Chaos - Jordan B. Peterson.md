## Highlights
- But the story of the golden calf also reminds us that without rules we quickly become slaves to our passions—and there’s nothing freeing about that. (Location 53)
- we are quick to aim low and worship qualities that are beneath us—in (Location 55)
- The old Hebrew story makes it clear how the ancients felt about our prospects for civilized behaviour in the absence of rules that seek to elevate our gaze and raise our standards. (Location 56)
- the best rules do not ultimately restrict us but instead facilitate our goals and make for fuller, freer lives. (Location 60)
- He seemed to be assuming, as a child would—before learning how dulled adults can become—that if he thought something was interesting, then so might others. (Location 93)
- if someone challenged or corrected him he really seemed to like it. (Location 102)
- getting them to do a kind of psychoanalytic exercise on themselves, in which they would free-associate about their past, present and future (now known as the Self-Authoring Program). (Location 108)
- The paintings were not there because Jordan had any totalitarian sympathies, but because he wanted to remind himself of something he knew he and everyone would rather forget: that hundreds of millions were murdered in the name of utopia. (Location 127)
- the first window onto the full extent of Jordan’s concern about our human capacity for evil in the name of good, and the psychological mystery of self-deception (Location 131)
- how all cultures have created stories to help us grapple with, and ultimately map, the chaos into which we are thrown at birth; (Location 140)
- chaos is everything that is unknown to us, and any unexplored territory that we must traverse, be it in the world outside or the psyche within. (Location 141)
- he shows that these stories have survived because they still provide guidance in dealing with uncertainty, and the unavoidable unknown. (Location 146)
- we all have to deal with the unknown, and we all attempt to move from chaos to order. (Location 150)
- Ideologies are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it. Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to “make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own chaos within. (Location 156)
- Ideologies are substitutes for true knowledge, and ideologues are always dangerous when they come to power, because a simple-minded I-know-it-all approach is no match for the complexity of existence. (Location 160)
- ideologues blame not themselves but all who see through the simplifications. (Location 162)
- Communism borrowed from the story of the Children of Israel in Egypt, with an enslaved class, rich persecutors, a leader, like Lenin, who goes abroad, lives among the enslavers, and then leads the enslaved to the promised land (the utopia; the dictatorship of the proletariat). (Location 164)
- evolution, of all things, helps to explain the profound psychological appeal and wisdom of many ancient stories, from Gilgamesh to the life of the Buddha, Egyptian mythology and the Bible. He showed, for instance, how stories about journeying voluntarily into the unknown—the hero’s quest—mirror universal tasks for which the brain evolved. (Location 190)
- all the ancients, from Buddha to the biblical authors, knew what every slightly worn-out adult knows, that life is suffering. If you are suffering, or someone close to you is, that’s sad. But alas, it’s not particularly special. (Location 195)
- adults in their lives had become so naively overprotective that they deluded themselves into thinking that not talking about suffering would in some way magically protect their children from it. (Location 203)
- the hero has to go into the unknown, into an unexplored territory, and deal with a new great challenge and take great risks. In the process, something of himself has to die, or be given up, so he can be reborn and meet the challenge. This requires courage, (Location 208)
- because alongside our wish to be free of rules, we all search for structure. (Location 220)
- The hunger among many younger people for rules, or at least guidelines, is greater today for good reason. In the West at least, millennials are living through a unique historical situation. They are, I believe, the first generation to have been so thoroughly taught two seemingly contradictory ideas about morality, simultaneously—at (Location 221)
- The first idea or teaching is that morality is relative, at best a personal “value judgment.” Relative means that there is no absolute right or wrong in anything; (Location 225)
- Today, the postmodernist left makes the additional claim that one group’s morality is nothing but its attempt to exercise power over another group. (Location 229)
- And, since we don’t know right from wrong, or what is good, just about the most inappropriate thing an adult can do is give a young person advice about how to live. (Location 234)
- serious intellectual and moral neglect. The relativists of my generation and Jordan’s, many of whom became their professors, chose to devalue thousands of years of human knowledge about how to acquire virtue, dismissing it as passé, “not relevant” or even “oppressive.” (Location 237)
    - Note: Even Freud in Civilizations and it’s Discontents states that civilization arises only when some restraining rules and morality are in place
- Aristotle defined the virtues simply as the ways of behaving that are most conducive to happiness in life. Vice was defined as the ways of behaving least conducive to happiness. (Location 241)
- Cultivating judgment about the difference between virtue and vice is the beginning of wisdom, (Location 244)
- modern relativism begins by asserting that making judgments about how to live is impossible, because there is no real good, and no true virtue (as these too are relative). (Location 245)
- They sign up for a humanities course, to study greatest books ever written. But they’re not assigned the books; instead they are given ideological attacks on them, based on some appalling simplification. Where the relativist is filled with uncertainty, the ideologue is the very opposite. He or she is hyper-judgmental and censorious, always knows what’s wrong about others, (Location 257)
- (But the idea that we can easily separate facts and values was and remains naive; to some extent, one’s values determine what one will pay attention to, and what will count as a fact.) (Location 268)
- For the ancients, the discovery that different people have different ideas about how, practically, to live, did not paralyze them; it deepened their understanding of humanity and led to some of the most satisfying conversations human beings have ever had, about how life might be lived. (Location 278)
- human beings, by their nature, have a proclivity to make rules, laws and customs. (Location 281)
- The idea that human life can be free of moral concerns is a fantasy. (Location 283)
- the foremost rule is that you must take responsibility for your own life. Period. (Location 296)
- universities with “safe spaces” where they don’t have to hear things they don’t want to—schooled to be risk-averse—has among it, now, millions who feel stultified by this underestimation of their potential resilience and who have embraced Jordan’s message (Location 299)
- In a crisis, the inevitable suffering that life entails can rapidly make a mockery of the idea that happiness is the proper pursuit of the individual. On the radio show, I suggested, instead, that a deeper meaning was required. I noted that the nature of such meaning was constantly re-presented in the great stories of the past, and that it had more to do with developing character in the face of suffering than with happiness. (Location 340)
- I described how I had come to believe that the constituent elements of the world as drama were order and chaos, and not material things. (Location 353)
- Order is where the people around you act according to well-understood social norms, and remain predictable and cooperative. (Location 355)
- Order is typically portrayed, symbolically—imaginatively—as masculine. (Location 356)
- Chaos, by contrast, is where—or when—something unexpected happens. Chaos emerges, in trivial form, when you tell a joke (Location 358)
- As the antithesis of symbolically masculine order, it’s presented imaginatively as feminine. It’s the new and unpredictable suddenly emerging in the midst of the commonplace familiar. It’s Creation and Destruction, the source of new things and the destination of the dead (Location 360)
- Order is the white, masculine serpent; Chaos, its black, feminine counterpart. The black dot in the white—and the white in the black—indicate the possibility of transformation: (Location 364)
- For the Taoists, meaning is to be found on the border between the ever-entwined pair. To walk that border is to stay on the path of life, the divine Way. And that’s much better than happiness. (Location 367)
- the reason or reasons for the nuclear standoff of the Cold War. I couldn’t understand how belief systems could be so important to people that they were willing to risk the destruction of the world to protect them. I came to realize that shared belief systems made people intelligible to one another—and that the systems weren’t just about belief. People who live by the same code are rendered mutually predictable to one another. They act in keeping with each other’s expectations and desires. They can cooperate. They can even compete peacefully, (Location 391)
- Shared beliefs simplify the world, as well, because people who know what to expect from one another can act together to tame the world. There is perhaps nothing more important than the maintenance of this organization—this simplification. If it’s threatened, the great ship of state rocks. (Location 396)
- It’s no wonder that people will fight to protect something that saves them from being possessed by emotions of chaos and terror (Location 406)
- In the absence of such a system of value, people simply cannot act. In fact, they can’t even perceive, because both action and perception require a goal, and a valid goal is, by necessity, something valued. We experience much of our positive emotion in relation to goals. (Location 409)
- Because we are vulnerable and mortal, pain and anxiety are an integral part of human existence. We must have something to set against the suffering that is intrinsic to Being.fn2 (Location 412)
- loss of group-centred belief renders life chaotic, miserable, intolerable; presence of group-centred belief makes conflict with other groups inevitable. In the West, we have been withdrawing from our tradition-, religion-and even nation-centred cultures, partly to decrease the danger of group conflict. But we are increasingly falling prey to the desperation of meaninglessness, and that is no improvement at all. (Location 417)
- How could the world be freed from the terrible dilemma of conflict, on the one hand, and psychological and social dissolution, on the other? The answer was this: through the elevation and development of the individual, and through the willingness of everyone to shoulder the burden of Being and to take the heroic path. (Location 441)
- But the alternative—the horror of authoritarian belief, the chaos of the collapsed state, the tragic catastrophe of the unbridled natural world, the existential angst and weakness of the purposeless individual—is clearly worse. (Location 445)
- We must bear a load, to justify our miserable existence. We require routine and tradition. That’s order. (Location 457)
- It’s there we find the meaning that justifies life and its inevitable suffering. (Location 461)
    - Note: At the line between order and chaos
- the sense of aggrieved victimhood that produces, first, resentment, then envy, and then the desire for vengeance and destruction. (Location 463)
- the willingness to take on that responsibility is identical to the decision to live a meaningful life. (Location 467)
- Protection from wind, rain and predators, as well as easy access to superior food, makes for a much less stressed existence. Territory matters, and there is little difference between territorial rights and social status. It is often a matter of life and death. (Location 517)
- The poor and stressed always die first, and in greater numbers. (Location 522)
- territory-seeking among animals produces conflict. (Location 524)
- animals who must co-habit with others in the same territories have in consequence learned many tricks to establish dominance, while risking the least amount of possible damage. (Location 530)
- Researchers have demonstrated that even a lobster raised in isolation knows what to do when such a thing happens.6 (Location 545)
- It begins to dance around, like a boxer, opening and raising its claws, moving backward, forward, and side to side, mirroring its opponent, (Location 547)
- jets under its eyes to direct streams of liquid at its opponent. (Location 549)
- With antennae whipping madly and claws folded downward, one will advance, and the other retreat. Then the defender will advance, and the aggressor retreat. (Location 554)
- the now enraged lobsters come at each other viciously, with their claws extended, to grapple. Each tries to flip the other on its back. (Location 558)
- Level 4. Doing so involves extreme risk, and is not something to be engaged in without forethought: one or both lobsters will emerge damaged from the ensuing fray, perhaps fatally. (Location 561)
- A vanquished competitor loses confidence, sometimes for days. (Location 567)
- If a dominant lobster is badly defeated, its brain basically dissolves. Then it grows a new, subordinate’s brain—one more appropriate to its new, lowly position.8 (Location 568)
- a painful transformation after a serious defeat in romance or career may feel some sense of kinship with the once successful crustacean. (Location 572)
- A lobster loser’s brain chemistry differs importantly from that of a lobster winner. This is reflected in their relative postures. (Location 573)
- communication between lobster neurons: serotonin and octopamine. Winning increases the ratio of the former to the latter. A lobster with high levels of serotonin and low levels of octopamine is a cocky, (Location 575)
- A flexed lobster extends its appendages so that it can look tall and dangerous, (Location 577)
- The drugs prescribed to depressed human beings, which are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, have much the same chemical and behavioural effect. (Location 580)
- Prozac even cheers up lobsters.10 (Location 582)
- Less provocation is necessary to trigger that reflex in a defeated lobster. You can see an echo of that in the heightened startle reflex characteristic of the soldier or battered child with post-traumatic stress disorder. (Location 586)
- It’s winner-take-all in the lobster world, just as it is in human societies, where the top 1 percent have as much loot as the bottom 50 percent11—and (Location 590)
- scientific papers (Location 593)
- musicians (Location 594)
- authors (Location 595)
- classical composers (Location 597)
- Pareto (1848–1923), an Italian polymath, noticed its applicability to wealth distribution in the early twentieth century, and it appears true for every society ever studied, regardless of governmental form. (Location 605)
- the resultant hierarchy is exceedingly stable. (Location 612)
- female lobsters (who also fight hard for territory during the explicitly maternal stages of their existence14) identify the top guy quickly, and become irresistibly attracted to him. (Location 616)
- They let the males fight it out and peel their paramours from the top. (Location 621)
- His aggression has made him successful, so he’s likely to react in a dominant, irritable manner. Furthermore, he’s large, healthy and powerful. It’s no easy task to switch his attention from fighting to mating. (If properly charmed, however, he will change his behaviour towards the female. This is the lobster equivalent of Fifty Shades of Grey, the fastest-selling paperback of all time, and the eternal Beauty-and-the-Beast plot of archetypal romance. (Location 624)
- males who stay on top longer are those who form reciprocal coalitions with their lower-status compatriots, and who pay careful attention to the troupe’s females and their infants. (Location 632)
- But lobsters are still comparatively primitive, (Location 634)
- we know that lobsters have been around, in one form or another, for more than 350 million years.16 (Location 642)
- This means that dominance hierarchies have been an essentially permanent feature of the environment to which all complex life has adapted. (Location 645)
- It is a truism of biology that evolution is conservative. When something evolves, it must build upon what nature has already produced. New features may be added, and old features may undergo some alteration, but most things remain the same. It is for this reason that the wings of bats, the hands of human beings, and the fins of whales look astonishingly alike in their skeletal form. (Location 648)
- First, it is easy to assume that “nature” is something with a nature—something static. But it’s not: at least not in any simple sense. It’s static and dynamic, at the same time. The environment—the nature that selects—itself transforms. (Location 658)
- There is nothing so certain that it cannot vary. Even the sun itself has its cycles of instability. (Location 663)
- As the environment supporting a species transforms and changes, the features that make a given individual successful in surviving and reproducing also transform and change. (Location 674)
- creatures are in a dance with nature, (Location 676)
- “In my kingdom,” as the Red Queen tells Alice in Wonderland, “you have to run as fast as you can just to stay in the same place.” (Location 677)
- Some things change quickly, but they are nested within other things that change less quickly (Location 679)
- It’s chaos, within order, within chaos, within higher order. (Location 682)
- The leaf, when perceived, might blind the observer to the tree. The tree can blind him to the forest. (Location 683)
- If Mother Nature wasn’t so hell-bent on our destruction, it would be easier for us to exist in simple harmony with her dictates. (Location 691)
- And this brings us to a third erroneous concept: that nature is something strictly segregated from the cultural constructs that have emerged within (Location 692)
- “nature” is “what selects,” and the longer a feature has existed the more time it has had to be selected—and to shape life. It does not matter whether that feature is physical and biological, or social and cultural. (Location 694)
- Dominance hierarchies are older than trees. (Location 702)
- Much of the basic neurochemistry is the same. (Location 708)
- Low serotonin means less happiness, more pain and anxiety, more illness, and a shorter lifespan—among humans, just as among crustaceans. (Location 712)
- The ancient part of your brain specialized for assessing dominance watches how you are treated by other people. On that evidence, it renders a determination of your value and assigns you a status. (Location 732)
- Emergencies are common at the bottom, and you must be ready to survive. Unfortunately, that physical hyper-response, that constant alertness, burns up a lot of precious energy and physical resources. This response is really what everyone calls stress, and it is by no means only or even primarily psychological. It’s a reflection of the genuine constraints of unfortunate circumstances. (Location 735)
- The ancient counter will even shut down your immune system, expending the energy and resources required for future health now, during the crises of the present. (Location 743)
- You can delay gratification, without forgoing it forever. You can afford to be a reliable and thoughtful citizen. (Location 753)
- Sometimes, however, the counter mechanism can go wrong. (Location 755)
- It is for this reason that routine is so necessary. The acts of life we repeat every day need to be automatized. They must be turned into stable and reliable habits, so they lose their complexity and gain predictability and simplicity. (Location 757)
- eat a fat and protein-heavy breakfast as soon as possible after they awaken (Location 765)
- the excess insulin in their bloodstream will mop up all their blood sugar. Then they become hypoglycemic and psycho-physiologically unstable.22 All day. (Location 768)
- The same destructive loop happens within people’s lives. Much of the time, when it happens, we label it mental illness, even though it’s not only or even at all occurring inside people’s psyches. (Location 780)
- Agoraphobia is the consequence of a positive feedback loop. (Location 795)
- This means that the damage caused by the bullying (the lowering of status and confidence) can continue, even after the bullying has ended.25 (Location 831)
- In more complex cases, a habitual assumption of subordination renders the person more stressed and uncertain than necessary, and their habitually submissive posturing continues to attract genuine negative attention from one or more of the fewer and generally less successful bullies still extant in the adult world. (Location 834)
- But just as often, people are bullied because they won’t fight back. This happens not infrequently to people who are by temperament compassionate and self-sacrificing—particularly if they are also high in negative emotion, and make a lot of gratifying noises of suffering when someone sadistic confronts them (Location 844)
- those who are only or merely compassionate and self-sacrificing (and naïve and exploitable) cannot call forth the genuinely righteous and appropriately self-protective anger necessary to defend themselves. If you can bite, you generally don’t have to. When skillfully integrated, the ability to respond with aggression and violence decreases rather than increases the probability that actual aggression will become necessary. (Location 853)
- The forces of tyranny expand inexorably to fill the space made available for their existence. (Location 858)
- Then I get them to see such action as part of the force that holds tyranny at bay—at the social level, as much as the individual. (Location 869)
- It is in this manner that the willingness of the individual to stand up for him or herself protects everyone from the corruption of society. (Location 871)
- There is very little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction, integrated, and strength of character. This is one of the most difficult lessons of life. (Location 884)
- Emotion is partly bodily expression, and can be amplified (or dampened) by that expression.29 Some of the positive feedback loops instantiated by body language can occur beyond the private confines of subjective experience, (Location 899)
- If you start to straighten up, then people will look at and treat you differently. (Location 905)
- Standing up means voluntarily accepting the burden of Being. Your nervous system responds in an entirely different manner when you face the demands of life voluntarily. You respond to a challenge, instead of bracing for a catastrophe. (Location 910)
- To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, with eyes wide open. It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable order. (Location 914)
- It means casting dead, rigid and too tyrannical order back into the chaos in which it was generated; it means withstanding the ensuing uncertainty, and establishing, in consequence, a better, more meaningful and more productive order. (Location 921)
- you may be able to stand, even during the illness of a loved one, even during the death of a parent, and allow others to find strength alongside you when they would otherwise be overwhelmed with despair. (Location 931)
- Then the meaning of your life may be sufficient to keep the corrupting influence of mortal despair at bay. Then you may be able to accept the terrible burden of the World, and find joy. (Location 934)
- Physicians and pharmacists tend to blame such patients for their noncompliance, inaction and error. You can lead a horse to water, they reason. Psychologists tend to take a dim view of such judgments. We are trained to assume that the failure of patients to follow professional advice is the fault of the practitioner, not the patient. (Location 946)
- Most people are happy to accept the trade-off. Recipients of transplants still suffer the effects of organ rejection, despite the existence and utility of these drugs. It’s not because the drugs fail (although they sometimes do). It’s more often because those prescribed the drugs do not take them. (Location 961)
- People are better at filling and properly administering prescription medication to their pets than to themselves. (Location 973)
- Take pain, for example—subjective pain. That’s something so real no argument can stand against it. Everyone acts as if their pain is real—ultimately, finally real. Pain matters, more than matter matters. (Location 1000)
- In any case, that which we subjectively experience can be likened much more to a novel or a movie than to a scientific description of physical reality. It is the drama of lived experience—the unique, tragic, personal death of your father, compared to the objective death listed in the hospital records; (Location 1003)
- the world of experience has primal constituents, as well. These are the necessary elements whose interactions define drama and fiction. One of these is chaos. Another is order. The third (as there are three) is the process that mediates between the two, which appears identical to what modern people call consciousness. (Location 1008)
- proper understanding of the third that allows us the only real way out. (Location 1011)
- It is, in short, all those things and situations we neither know nor understand. Chaos is also the formless potential from which the God of Genesis 1 called forth order using language at the beginning of time. It’s the same potential from which we, made in that Image, call forth the novel and ever-changing moments of our lives. And Chaos is freedom, dreadful freedom, too. (Location 1018)
- Order, by contrast, is explored territory. (Location 1021)
- Order is the floor beneath your feet, and your plan for the day. (Location 1024)
- where the behavior of the world matches our expectations and our desires; (Location 1027)
    - Note: In chaos a totalitarian regime can seem the only way to derive order from it using ideologies disguised as morals. More precisely they give goals and values derived from morals that are actually ideologies, this give structure and order and this matches the expectations and desires of society
- order is sometimes tyranny and stultification, as well, when the demand for certainty and uniformity and purity becomes too one-sided. (Location 1028)
- In order, we’re able to think about things in the long term. (Location 1030)
- Chaos is the deep ocean bottom to which Pinocchio voyaged to rescue his father from Monstro, whale and fire-breathing dragon. That journey into darkness and rescue is the most difficult thing a puppet must do, if he wants to be real; if he wants to extract himself from the temptations of deceit and acting and victimization and impulsive pleasure and totalitarian subjugation; if he wants to take his place as a genuine Being in the world. (Location 1040)
    - Note: Take responsibility for us
- Our brains respond instantly when chaos appears, with simple, hyper-fast circuits (Location 1055)
- chaos and order. Those are perceived, experienced and understood (to the degree that they are understood at all) as personalities—and (Location 1062)
- We see what things mean just as fast or faster than we see what they are.33 Perception of things as entities with personality also occurs before perception of things as things. (Location 1067)
- We evolved, over millennia, within intensely social circumstances. This means that the most significant elements of our environment of origin were personalities, not things, objects or situations. (Location 1072)
- male and female and parent and child are categories, for us—natural categories, deeply embedded in our perceptual, emotional and motivational structures. Our brains are deeply social. (Location 1080)
- Reality itself is whatever we contend with when we are striving to survive and reproduce. A lot of that is other beings, their opinions of us, and their communities. (Location 1084)
- Our most basic category—as old, in some sense, as the sexual act itself—appears to be that of sex, male and female. We appear to have taken that primordial knowledge of structured, creative opposition and begun to interpret everything through its lens.37 (Location 1093)
- Order, the known, appears symbolically associated with masculinity (as illustrated in the aforementioned yang of the Taoist yin-yang symbol). This is perhaps because the primary hierarchical structure of human society is masculine, as it is among most animals, including the chimpanzees who are our closest genetic and, arguably, behavioural match. (Location 1096)
- Order, when pushed too far, when imbalanced, can also manifest itself destructively and terribly. (Location 1103)
- Chaos—the unknown—is symbolically associated with the feminine. This is partly because all the things we have come to know were born, originally, of the unknown, just as all beings we encounter were born of mothers. Chaos is mater, origin, source, mother; materia, the substance from which all things are made. It is also what matters, or what is the matter—the (Location 1105)
- Chaos, the eternal feminine, is also the crushing force of sexual selection. Women are choosy maters (unlike female chimps, their closest animal counterparts39). (Location 1110)
- It is Woman as Nature who looks at half of all men and says, “No!” (Location 1116)
- Women’s proclivity to say no, more than any other force, has shaped our evolution into the creative, industrious, upright, large-brained (competitive, aggressive, domineering) creatures that we are.42 (Location 1119)
- The Star of David is, for example, the downward pointing triangle of femininity and the upward pointing triangle of the male.fn1 It’s the same for the yoni and lingam of Hinduism (which come covered with snakes, our ancient adversaries and provocateurs: the Shiva Linga is depicted with snake deities called the Nagas). The ancient Egyptians represented Osiris, god of the state, and Isis, goddess of the underworld, as twin cobras with their tails knotted together. The same symbol was used in China to portray Fuxi and Nuwa, creators of humanity and of writing. The representations in Christianity are less abstract, more like personalities, but the familiar Western images of the Virgin Mary with the Christ Child and the Pietà both express the female/male dual unity, as does the traditional insistence on the androgyny of Christ.43 (Location 1123)
- the structure of the brain itself at a gross morphological level appears to reflect this duality. This, to me, indicates the fundamental, beyond-the-metaphorical reality of this symbolically feminine/masculine divide, since the brain is adapted, by definition, to reality itself (that is, reality conceptualized in this quasi-Darwinian manner). (Location 1131)
- That’s why we understand the strange, surreal stories of Pinocchio, and Sleeping Beauty, and The Lion King, and The Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast, with their eternal landscapes of known and unknown, world and underworld. (Location 1141)
- Many things begin to fall into place when you begin to consciously understand the world in this manner. It’s as if the knowledge of your body and soul falls into alignment with the knowledge of your intellect. (Location 1144)
- We experience meaningful engagement when we mediate appropriately between them. (Location 1152)
- To straddle that fundamental duality is to be balanced: to have one foot firmly planted in order and security, and the other in chaos, possibility, growth and adventure. When life suddenly reveals itself as intense, gripping and meaningful; when time passes and you’re so engrossed in what you’re doing you don’t notice—it is there and then that you are located precisely on the border between order and chaos. (Location 1154)
- That’s what music is telling you, too, when you’re listening—even more, perhaps, when you’re dancing—when its harmonious layered patterns of predictability and unpredictability make meaning itself well up from the most profound depths of your Being. (Location 1160)
- Living things are always to be found in places they can master, surrounded by things and situations that make them vulnerable. Order is not enough. You can’t just be stable, and secure, and unchanging, because there are still vital and important new things to be learned. Nonetheless, chaos can be too much. (Location 1166)
- The serpent in Eden therefore means the same thing as the black dot in the yin side of the Taoist yin/yang symbol of totality—that is, the possibility of the unknown and revolutionary suddenly manifesting itself where everything appears calm. It just does not appear possible, even for God himself, to make a bounded space completely protected from the outside—not in the real world, with its necessary limitations, surrounded by the transcendent. (Location 1193)
- The worst of all possible snakes is the eternal human proclivity for evil. The worst of all possible snakes is psychological, spiritual, personal, internal. (Location 1208)
- the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.48 (Location 1211)

- Now, no clear-seeing, conscious woman is going to tolerate an unawakened man. So, Eve immediately shares the fruit with Adam. That makes him self-conscious. Little has changed. Women have been making men self-conscious since the beginning of time. They do this primarily by rejecting them—but they also do it by shaming them, if men do not take responsibility. (Location 1235)
- Eve wake up, all right, but only enough to discover some terrible things. First, they notice that they’re naked. (Location 1253)
- Naked means vulnerable and easily damaged. Naked means subject to judgment for beauty and health. (Location 1259)
    - Note: God judges the AFTER they eat and become naked

- people, unsettled by their vulnerability, eternally fear to tell the truth, to mediate between chaos and order, (Location 1278)
- Thus, we can understand and sympathize with Eve’s error. She was deceived by the best. But Adam! No one forced his words from his mouth. (Location 1287)
- Second, He tells the woman that she will now bring forth children in sorrow, and desire an unworthy, sometimes resentful man, who will in consequence lord her biological fate over her, permanently. (Location 1290)
- This all means that women pay a high price for pregnancy and child-rearing, particularly in the early stages, and that one of the inevitable consequences is increased dependence upon the sometimes unreliable and always problematic good graces of men. (Location 1300)
- Your godlike vision, granted to you by snake, fruit and lover, allows you to see far, even into the future. But those who see into the future can also eternally see trouble coming, and must then prepare for all contingencies and possibilities. To do that, you will have to eternally sacrifice the present for the future. You must put aside pleasure for security. In short: you will have to work. (Location 1304)
- Perhaps Heaven is something you must build, and immortality something you must earn. (Location 1311)
- Why would someone buy prescription medication for his dog, and then so carefully administer it, when he would not do the same for himself? Now you have the answer, derived from one of the foundational texts of mankind. Why should anyone take care of anything as naked, ugly, ashamed, frightened, worthless, cowardly, resentful, defensive and accusatory as a descendant of Adam? Even if that thing, that being, is himself? (Location 1312)

- We can terrify other people, consciously. (Location 1337)

    - Note: This is also something on accordanxe with the stpic feachings, learn to be grateful and your life will only be better (I think with balance, only look at what is good and you might miss some serious fhreath or growth opportunities, like the fish that is cughtby a monkfish)

- Thus, you set the following goal: by the end of the day, I want things in my life to be a tiny bit better than they were this morning. Then you ask yourself, “What could I do, that I would do, that would accomplish that, and what small thing would I like as a reward?” Then you do what you have decided to do, even if you do it badly.

- you will start to slowly see what is “better,” once you have truly decided to want it. (Location 2039)
- You can’t fool your implicit perceptual structures. (Location 2042)
- And you must be cautious, because making your life better means adopting a lot of responsibility, and that takes more effort and care than living stupidly in pain and remaining arrogant, deceitful and resentful. (Location 2043)
- This doesn’t mean that you can have what you want merely by wishing it, (Location 2047)
- The world is still there, with its structures and limits. (Location 2048)

- Religion is instead about proper behaviour. (Location 2069)
- You cannot aim yourself at anything if you are completely undisciplined and untutored. (Location 2073)
- It is therefore necessary and desirable for religions to have a dogmatic element. What good is a value system that does not provide a stable structure? (Location 2075)

    - Note: Interesting to say that god in the pld testament was closer to a lion than a benevolent being. But a lion with such power might be closer to a tyrant that a leader I think
- New Testament God is often presented as a different character (Location 2120)
- more naively welcoming, but (in precise proportion to that) less believable. (Location 2123)
- The all-good God, in a post-Auschwitz world? (Location 2124)
- Nietzsche, (Location 2125)
- considered New Testament God the worst literary crime in Western history. (Location 2126)
- In other words, you decide to act as if existence might be justified by its goodness—if only you behaved properly. And it is that decision, that declaration of existential faith, that allows you to overcome nihilism, and resentment, and arrogance. (Location 2152)
- Faith is not the childish belief in magic. (Location 2155)
- It is instead the realization that the tragic irrationalities of life must be counterbalanced by an equally irrational commitment to the essential goodness of Being. (Location 2156)
- This doesn’t mean “make yourself stupid.” It means the opposite. It means instead that you must quit manoeuvring and calculating and conniving and scheming and enforcing and demanding and avoiding and ignoring and punishing. It means you must place your old strategies aside. It means, instead, that you must pay attention, as you may never have paid attention before. (Location 2160)
    - Note: It basically means stop focusing on things going into a very specific way that you want by trying to manipulate everything. Focus on what is important, on what you can actually control ( only yourself ) and have faith that the resti will at some point fall into place
      I aleays wandered at which point focusing in yourself become egoism, and at which point become nihilism
      You do not act like other things do not matter ( nihilism ) but like you have faith they will take care of themself if you let them
      You do not only care about you for the sake of yoursel as an egoist person, you care about yourself so you can put your house in order and only after truly help and inspire other to do the same, you help yourself with the goal of doing better for everyone
- Search until you find something that bothers you, that you could fix, that you would fix, and then fix it. That might be enough for the day. (Location 2167)
- What if you instructed your wife, or your husband, to say “good job” after you fixed whatever you fixed? (Location 2176)
- The people from whom thanks you want might not be very proficient in offering it, to begin with, but that shouldn’t stop you. (Location 2177)
- You are, on the one hand, the most complex thing in the entire universe, and on the other, someone who can’t even set the clock on your microwave. Don’t over-estimate your self-knowledge. (Location 2180)
- Now you will be asking yourself, habitually, “What could I do, that I would do, to make Life a little better?” You are not dictating to yourself what “better” must be. You are not being a totalitarian, or a utopian, (Location 2185)
- Aim high. Set your sights on the betterment of Being. (Location 2187)
- It is this, in my reading, that is the culminating ethic of the canon of the West. (Location 2189)
- the New Testament. This is the attempt of the Spirit of Mankind to transform the understanding of ethics from the initial, necessary Thou Shalt Not of the child and the Ten Commandments into the fully articulated, positive vision of the true individual. (Location 2191)
- This is not the cessation of sin, but sin’s opposite, good itself. (Location 2194)
- concentrate on the day, so that you can live in the present, and attend completely and properly to what is right in front of you—but do that only after you have decided to let what is within shine forth, so that it can justify Being and illuminate the world. (Location 2195)
- sacrifice whatever it is that must be sacrificed so that you can pursue the highest good. (Location 2197)
- But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. (Location 2205)
    - Note: This is an expression that make me think again of the definition or rather true meaning of fait. Decide where you want to go, understand what is and what is not in your control, face what is in front of you that deserve attentio with alla your Being and keep doing this while having faith the the rest will fall into place at some point
- You no longer have to be envious, because you no longer know that someone else truly has it better. (Location 2210)
- You no longer have to be frustrated, because you have learned to aim low, and to be patient. (Location 2211)
- You are less concerned with the actions of other people, because you have plenty to do yourself. (Location 2213)
- Attend to the day, but aim at the highest good. (Location 2214)
- To journey happily may well be better than to arrive successfully.... (Location 2215)
- Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today. (Location 2218)

- The desire of his parents to let their child act without correction on every impulse perversely produced precisely the opposite effect: (Location 2232)
- Because they did not dare to teach him what “No” means, he had no conception of the reasonable limits enabling maximal toddler autonomy. (Location 2234)
- watched that same child, one year later, viciously push his younger sister backwards over a fragile glass-surfaced coffee table. His mother picked him up, immediately afterward (but not her frightened daughter), (Location 2239)

- This was the same four-year-old boy who clung to my wife for hours in absolute desperation and total commitment, when she tenaciously, persistently and mercifully managed to feed him an entire lunch-time meal, rewarding him throughout for his cooperation, and refusing to let him fail. (Location 2277)
- play—this boy broke immediately into a wide, radiant smile. It brought joy to everyone (Location 2287)
- it is the things that occur every single day that truly make up our lives, and time spent the same way over and again adds up at an alarming rate. (Location 2295)
- That conclusion merely displaces the problem, back in time. It explains nothing, and solves no problems. If society is corrupt, but not the individuals within it, then where did the corruption originate? (Location 2310)
- Our society faces the increasing call to deconstruct its stabilizing traditions to include smaller and smaller numbers of people who do not or will not fit into the categories upon which even our perceptions are based. This is not a good thing. Each person’s private trouble cannot be solved by a social revolution, because revolutions are destabilizing and dangerous. We have learned to live together and organize our complex societies slowly and incrementally, over vast stretches of time, and we do not understand with sufficient exactitude why what we are doing works. Thus, altering our ways of social being carelessly in the name of some ideological shibboleth (diversity springs to mind) is likely to produce far more trouble than good, given the suffering that even small revolutions generally produce.

- In general, people improve with age, (Location 2340)
- Bullying at the sheer and often terrible intensity of the schoolyard84 rarely manifests itself in grown-up society. (Location 2342)
- Chimps can literally tear each other to pieces—and they do. Human societies and their complex technologies cannot be blamed for that.88 (Location 2354)
    - Note: I do not total lui agree with this, the fact that they tear each other does not necessarily mean they are evil, expecially like here in the contest of intra tribal warfare
      Altghough I agree that chimpanzee are fucking evil as shit, way more than humans, maybe more like humans with no morality or hinibitors whatsoever
- Chimps don’t have much of a super-ego, and it is prudent to remember that the human capacity for self-control may also be overestimated. (Location 2360)
- Careful perusal of book as shocking and horrific as Iris Chang’s The Rape of Nanking,90 which describes the brutal decimation of that Chinese city by the invading Japanese, will disenchant even a committed romantic. (Location 2361)
    - Note: Why not, maybe they do have an ego, how can you say it for sure.
      Same thing for humans, overestimated how, horrible things happen in the world but in a mich smaller minorty, to me it seems very unlikely that humans in an island will necessarily end up mobbing killing and drinking the blod of the victims
- And the less said about Unit 731, a covert Japanese biological warfare research unit established at that time, the better. Read about it at your peril. You have been warned. (Location 2363)
    - Note: This is definitely something in favour of the argument but I still would not declare it sure, it still seems not the normality for humans like it is for chimpz
- But the evidence strongly suggests that human beings have become more peaceful, rather than less so, (Location 2368)
- This is a very instructive example of complex social structures serving to reduce, not exacerbate, the violent tendencies of human beings. (Location 2372)
- Because children, like other human beings, are not only good, they cannot simply be left to their own devices, untouched by society, and bloom into perfection. (Location 2377)
- Even dogs must be socialized if they are to become acceptable members of the pack—and children are much more complex than dogs. (Location 2378)
- This means that it is not just wrong to attribute all the violent tendencies of human beings to the pathologies of social structure. It’s wrong enough to be virtually backward. (Location 2380)
- Children must be shaped and informed, or they cannot thrive. (Location 2382)
- Children can be damaged as much or more by a lack of incisive attention as they are by abuse, mental or physical. (Location 2384)
- Children are damaged when their “mercifully” inattentive parents fail to make them sharp (Location 2385)
- They are uncarved blocks, trapped in a perpetual state of waiting-to-be. (Location 2389)
- was an almost universally-experienced internal warning signal indicating the comparative danger of establishing a relationship with a poorly socialized child: (Location 2396)
- immediate and inappropriate dependence (Location 2397)
    - Note: This form a positive (negative) feed back loop, where the unattended child is perceived as a risk to interact with and this lead to less and less attention ( more guidance than attention )
- the tremendous demand of time and resources that accepting such dependence would necessitate. (Location 2397)
- more often than not, modern parents are simply paralyzed by the fear that they will no longer be liked or even loved by their children if they chastise them for any reason. (Location 2402)
- They want their children’s friendship above all, and are willing to sacrifice respect to get it. (Location 2403)
- parents are more, not less, than friends. (Location 2404)
- the capacity of children to perceive or care about long-term consequences is very limited. (Location 2406)
- It is an act of responsibility to discipline a child. It is not anger at misbehavior. (Location 2408)
- It is instead a careful combination of mercy and long-term judgment. (Location 2409)
- any suggestion that all constraints placed on children are damaging can be perversely welcome. Such a notion, once accepted, allows adults who should know better to abandon their duty to serve as agents of enculturation and pretend that doing so is good for children. It’s a deep and pernicious act of self-deception. (Location 2412)
- We assume that rules will irremediably inhibit what would otherwise be the boundless and intrinsic creativity of our children, even though the scientific literature clearly indicates, first, that creativity beyond the trivial is shockingly rare96 and, second, that strict limitations facilitate rather than inhibit creative achievement.97 (Location 2415)
- Belief in the purely destructive element of rules and structure is frequently conjoined with the idea that children will make good choices about when to sleep and what to eat, if their perfect natures are merely allowed to manifest themselves. (Location 2419)
- Observing the consequences of teasing and taunting enables chimp and child alike to discover the limits of what might otherwise be a too-unstructured and terrifying freedom. (Location 2425)
- Imagine a toddler repeatedly striking his mother in the face. Why would he do such a thing? It’s a stupid question. It’s unacceptably naive. The answer is obvious. To dominate his mother. To see if he can get away with it. (Location 2434)
- Violence is the default. It’s easy. It’s peace that is difficult: learned, inculcated, earned. (Location 2436)
- Why do people take drugs? Not a mystery. It’s why they don’t take them all the time that’s the mystery. (Location 2437)
- We should be terrified out of our skulls at every second. But we’re not. (Location 2439)
- Two-year-olds, statistically speaking, are the most violent of people.99 (Location 2444)
- they do so to discover the true limits of permissible behaviour. (Location 2446)
- no child is going to undergo the effortful process of organizing and regulating their impulses, so that those impulses can coexist, without conflict, within the psyche of the child, and in the broader social world. (Location 2452)
- Half an hour for me was a week for my son. (Location 2463)
- I gave him a pat on the head, and told him that he was a good boy. And I meant it. When someone does something you are trying to get them to do, reward them. No grudge after victory. (Location 2471)
- My son collapsed, exhausted, on my chest. We had a nap together. And he liked me a lot better when he woke up than he had before he was disciplined. (Location 2474)
- There is just no talking to parents about their children—until they are ready to listen. (Location 2482)
- Reasoning with kids isn’t often of too much use, particularly under such circumstances, but I believe in fair warning. (Location 2486)
- Scared parents think that a crying child is always sad or hurt. This is simply not true. Anger is one of the most common reasons for crying. (Location 2488)
- Anger-crying is often an act of dominance, and should be dealt with as such. (Location 2491)
- This time, I laid him down, and kept my hand on his back. (Location 2493)
- kept him down and spoke calmly to him and told him he was a good boy and that he should relax. (Location 2494)
- We liked each other. Neither my wife nor I heard a peep out of him for the rest of the night. (Location 2499)
- Dad looked at me. He wanted to know. But he didn’t ask. And I didn’t tell. (Location 2502)
- The distance between disciplinarian and tyrant or punishment and torture is, indeed, easily traversed. (Location 2506)
    - Note: This is actually one of my biggest question marks in life, this constantly and always valid worry about balance
- It’s not that it’s impossible to discipline with reward. In fact, rewarding good behaviour can be very effective. (Location 2509)
- reward of just the right size: not small enough to be inconsequential, and not so large that it devalued future rewards. (Location 2516)
- So, you start his training by handing him a plate and having him hand it back. A pat on the head could follow. (Location 2521)
- You can teach virtually anyone anything with such an approach. First, figure out what you want. Then, watch the people around you like a hawk. Finally, whenever you see anything a bit more like what you want, swoop in (hawk, remember) and deliver a reward. (Location 2524)
- Skinner, however, was a realist. He noted that use of reward was very difficult: the observer had to attend patiently until the target spontaneously manifested the desired behaviour, and then reinforce. (Location 2529)
- Negative emotions, like their positive counterparts, help us learn. We need to learn, because we’re stupid and easily damaged. We can die. (Location 2533)
- negative emotions, for all their unpleasantness, protect us. (Location 2535)
- we feel more negative about a loss of a given size than we feel good about the same-sized gain. (Location 2537)
- Pain is more potent than pleasure, and anxiety more than hope. (Location 2537)
- Emotions, positive and negative, come in two usefully differentiated variants. Satisfaction (technically, satiation) tells us that what we did was good, while hope (technically, incentive reward) indicates that something pleasurable is on the way. Pain hurts us, so we won’t repeat actions (Location 2538)
- children would not have such a lengthy period of natural development, prior to maturity, if their behaviour did not have to be shaped. (Location 2546)
- Children also cannot be fully sheltered from fear and pain. (Location 2547)
- the fundamental moral question is not how to shelter children completely from misadventure and failure, so they never experience any fear or pain, but how to maximize their learning so that useful knowledge may be gained with minimal cost. (Location 2550)
- This means, symbolically, that the two monarchs are overprotecting their beloved daughter, by setting up a world around her that has nothing negative in it. But this does not protect her. It makes her weak. (Location 2555)
- They continue with their strategy of removing all dangerous things—but in doing so they leave their daughter naïve, immature and weak. (Location 2560)
- In doing so (again, symbolically speaking) she chooses unconsciousness over the terror of adult life. (Location 2565)
- overprotected children, who can be brought low—and then desire the bliss of unconsciousness—by their first real contact with failure or, worse, genuine malevolence, (Location 2566)
- Worse: when she tries to make friends, it won’t go well, because of her lack of social sophistication. Children her own age will be put off by her inability to cooperate. (Location 2572)
- You can discipline your children, or you can turn that responsibility over to the harsh, uncaring judgmental world—and (Location 2579)
- Accepting an objection as formulated is halfway to accepting its validity, and that can be dangerous if the question is ill-posed. (Location 2584)
- First, why should a child be subject? That’s easy. Every child must listen to and obey adults because he or she is dependent on the care that one or more imperfect grown-ups is willing to bestow. (Location 2585)
    - Note: When you accept a question formulated with ill intents like provocation or similar that does not hold any potential discussion or reflection value you are giving the question a power that it should not have
- Every child should also be taught to comply gracefully with the expectations of civil society. This does not mean crushed into mindless ideological conformity. It means instead that parents must reward those attitudes and actions that will bring their child success in the world outside the family, (Location 2590)
- There’s a tight window of opportunity for this, as well, so getting it right quickly matters. If a child has not been taught to behave properly by the age of four, it will forever be difficult for him or her to make friends. The research literature is quite clear on this. (Location 2593)
- Rejected children cease to develop, because they are alienated from their peers. (Location 2595)
- Much more of our sanity than we commonly realize is a consequence of our fortunate immersion in a social community. (Location 2597)
- But in civilized, open societies, the majority abide by a functional social contract, aimed at mutual betterment—or (Location 2601)
    - Note: This is common sense that seems we have kinda forgotten. Most people still follow a path that lead to a better society, sure there are exceptions and bad parents but that is not the norm otherwise our society would have crumbled already
- If a society does not adequately reward productive, pro-social behavior, insists upon distributing resources in a markedly arbitrary and unfair manner, and allows for theft and exploitation, it will not remain conflict-free for long. (Location 2603)
- This is even true, in simpler form, of the hierarchies of chimpanzees, which is an indication of its fundamental, biological and non-arbitrary emergent truth.104 (Location 2605)
    - Note: There are many studies showing that even with the extreme violent nature of chimpanzee they still tend organize and for organizations. Even the strongest alpha is powerless when facing 5 smaller chimpanzee but they no better than that
- This is the ethical—even legal—equivalent of Occam’s razor, the scientist’s conceptual guillotine, which states that the simplest possible hypothesis is preferable. (Location 2618)
- too many rules. That path leads to frustration. (Location 2620)
- So now we have two general principles of discipline. The first: limit the rules. The second: Use the least force necessary to enforce those rules. (Location 2628)
- Do not bite, kick or hit, except in self-defence. (Location 2630)
- Eat in a civilized and thankful manner, so that people are happy to have you at their house, and pleased to feed you. Learn to share, so other kids will play with you. (Location 2630)
- Go to sleep properly, and peaceably, so that your parents can have a private life and not resent your existence. (Location 2632)
- Be good company when something fun is happening, so that you’re invited for the fun. (Location 2634)
- What is minimum necessary force? This must be established experimentally, starting with the smallest possible intervention. (Location 2636)
- children will definitely misbehave more in public, because they are experimenting: (Location 2641)
- When our children were little and we took them to restaurants, they attracted smiles. They sat nicely and ate politely. They couldn’t keep it up for long, but we didn’t keep them there too long. (Location 2643)
- We weren’t always happy, and our children weren’t always properly behaved. But they were most of the time, (Location 2646)
- They could see that people liked them. This also reinforced their good behaviour. That was the reward. (Location 2647)
- Part of establishing a relationship with your son or daughter is learning how that small person responds to disciplinary intervention—and then intervening effectively. (Location 2653)
    - Note: With the least amount of punishment possible that is still effective though
- Deprivation of liberty causes pain in a manner essentially similar to that of physical trauma. The same can be said of the use of social isolation (including time out). We know this neurobiologically. The same brain areas mediate response to all three, and all are ameliorated by the same class of drugs, opiates.105 (Location 2658)
- The answer is simple: whatever will stop it fastest, within reason. Because the alternative could be fatal. (Location 2664)
- Those unconstrained four-year-olds, in turn, are often those who were unduly aggressive, by nature, at age two. (Location 2669)
- They comprise about five per cent of boys, and a much smaller percentage of girls.106 To unthinkingly parrot the magic line “There is no excuse for physical punishment” is also to foster the delusion that teenage devils magically emerge from once-innocent little child-angels. (Location 2670)
- A woman can say no to a powerful, narcissistic man only because she has social norms, the law and the state backing her up. A parent can only say no to a child who wants a third piece of cake because he or she is larger, stronger and more capable than the child (Location 2675)
- What no means, in the final analysis, is always “If you continue to do that, something you do not like will happen to you.” (Location 2678)
- What does a child who ignores adults and holds them in contempt have to look forward to? Why grow up at all? And that’s the story of Peter Pan, who thinks all adults are variants of Captain Hook, tyrannical and terrified of his own mortality (Location 2681)
- The only time no ever means no in the absence of violence is when it is uttered by one civilized person to another. (Location 2683)
- How hard someone is hit, and why they are hit, cannot merely be ignored when speaking of hitting. (Location 2689)
- Every gingerbread house has a witch inside it that devours children. (Location 2697)
- if the misbehaving child is welcome as soon as he controls his temper. An angry child should sit by himself until he calms down. (Location 2701)
- That means the child wins—instead of his anger. The rule is “Come be with us as soon as you can behave properly.” (Location 2702)
- If you’re still mad, maybe he hasn’t completely repented—or maybe you should do something about your tendency to hold a grudge. (Location 2704)
- Disciplinary principle 1: limit the rules. Principle 2: use minimum necessary force. (Location 2712)
- Here’s a third: parents should come in pairs.107 (Location 2713)
- it’s easy for a parent to make a mistake. (Location 2714)
- it is necessary to have someone else around, to observe, and step in, and discuss. (Location 2716)
- Parents should come in pairs so the father of a newborn can watch the new mother so she won’t get worn out (Location 2718)
- I am not saying we should be mean to single mothers, (Location 2719)

- parents should understand their own capacity to be harsh, vengeful, arrogant, resentful, angry and deceitful. (Location 2722)
- they remain willfully blind to that fact. (Location 2724)
- even the most hypothetically selfless parent will become resentful. (Location 2728)
- A parent who is seriously aware of his or her limited tolerance and capacity for misbehaviour when provoked can therefore seriously plan a proper disciplinary strategy—particularly if monitored by an equally awake partner—and never let things degenerate to the point where genuine hatred emerges. (Location 2732)
- Parents have a duty to act as proxies for the real world—merciful proxies, caring proxies—but proxies, nonetheless. This obligation supersedes any responsibility to ensure happiness, foster creativity, or boost self-esteem. (Location 2737)

- Discuss your likes and dislikes with regards to your children with your partner or, failing that, a friend. But do not be afraid to have likes and dislikes. (Location 2746)
- Having clarified your stance—having assessed yourself for pettiness, arrogance and resentment—you take the next step, and you make your children behave. You take responsibility for their discipline. (Location 2747)
- A child who pays attention, instead of drifting, and can play, and does not whine, and is comical, but not annoying, and is trustworthy—that child will have friends wherever he goes. (Location 2753)
- He will thrive, in what can so easily be a cold, unforgiving and hostile world. Clear rules make for secure children and calm, rational parents. (Location 2755)

- Instead of widening the tear in the cultural fabric she inherited, and transmitting it, she sewed it up. (Location 2873)

- Life is suffering. That’s clear. There is no more basic, irrefutable truth. It’s basically what God tells Adam and Eve, immediately before he kicks them out of Paradise. (Location 2980)
- In an ultimately meaningless universe, what possible difference could it make? (Location 2991)

- Why not determine to live in that manner? Or is there an alternative, more powerful and more compelling? Our ancestors worked out very sophisticated answers to such questions, but we still don’t understand them very well. (Location 3012)

- making a ritual sacrifice to God was an early and sophisticated enactment of the idea of the usefulness of delay. (Location 3050)
- Our ancestors acted out a drama, a fiction: they personified the force that governs fate as a spirit that can be bargained with, traded with, as if it were another human being. And the amazing thing is that it worked. (Location 3058)
- This was in part because the future is largely composed of other human beings—often (Location 3059)
- the future is a judgmental father. (Location 3062)
- But a physician can—to paraphrase George W.—really put food on his family. (Location 3067)
    - Note: Thi is not necessarily true. To just put on the table you can sacrifce much less ad to to REALLY pit food on the table you need to be one of the best physcians in the world not just a physcian which is not just a matter of sacrifice but a strong luck is also required at those levels
- Furthermore, it often appears that sacrifices of apparently high quality are not rewarded with a better future—and it’s not clear why. Why isn’t God happy? (Location 3080)
- to complicate the matter, such delay only becomes useful when civilization has stabilized itself enough to guarantee the existence of the delayed reward, in the future. (Location 3085)
- In such a manner, “mammoth” becomes “future mammoth,” and “future mammoth” becomes “personal reputation.” (Location 3098)
- To share does not mean to give away something you value, and get nothing back. That is instead only what every child who refuses to share fears it means. To share means, properly, to initiate the process of trade. A child who can’t share—who can’t trade—can’t have any friends, (Location 3099)

- Action came first (as it had to, as the animals we once were could act but could not think). (Location 3120)

- Why is God’s going further necessary? Why does He—why does life—impose such demands? (Location 3133)
- The cause is instead that which is currently most valued, subjectively and personally. Why? Because the world is revealed, to an indeterminate degree, through the template of your values (much (Location 3137)
- If the world you are seeing is not the world you want, therefore, it’s time to examine your values. It’s time to rid yourself of your current presuppositions. It’s time to let go. It might even be time to sacrifice what you love best, so that you can become who you might become, instead of staying who you are. (Location 3138)
- Something valuable, given up, ensures future prosperity. Something valuable, sacrificed, pleases the Lord. (Location 3147)
- That’s symbolized, perhaps, in God’s insistence on circumcision as part of Abraham’s sacrificial routine, where the part is offered, symbolically, to redeem the whole. (Location 3150)

      Nowthat I think about it that might be a totally different voice, the coscience is the one that tells you to get up or at least to feel bad after. Still I kinda do not feel like giving it this much trust
- We work because we have awakened to the truth of our own vulnerability, our subjugation to disease and death, and wish to protect ourselves for as long as possible. Once we can see the future, we must prepare for it, or live in denial and terror. (Location 3216)
- You understand what it’s like to be fearful, and angry, and resentful, and bitter. You understand what pain means. And once you truly understand such feelings in yourself, and how they’re produced, you understand how to produce them in others. (Location 3221)
- It’s much worse, however, if he had actually foregone the pleasures of the moment—if he had strived and toiled and things still didn’t work out—if he was rejected, despite his efforts. Then he’s lost the present and the future. (Location 3231)
- has been my experience, however, that human beings are strong enough to tolerate the implicit tragedies of Being without faltering—without breaking or, worse, breaking bad. (Location 3250)

- Abel could please God—a non-trivial and unlikely accomplishment—but he could not overcome human evil. For this reason, Abel is archetypally incomplete. (Location 3272)
- This is where the idea of Christ’s taking on the sins of mankind as if they were His own becomes key, opening the door to deep understanding of the desert encounter with the devil himself. (Location 3307)

- Horus—often regarded as a precursor to Christ, historically and conceptually speaking137—experienced the same thing, when he confronted his evil uncle Set,fn2 usurper of the throne of Osiris, Horus’s father. Horus, the all-seeing Egyptian falcon god, the Egyptian eye of supreme, eternal attention itself, has the courage to contend with Set’s true nature, meeting him in direct combat. (Location 3330)

- “Do not put the Lord your God to the test” (Matthew 4:7)—this answer, though rather brief, dispenses with the second temptation. Christ does not casually order or even dare ask God to intervene on his behalf. He refuses to dispense with His responsibility for the events of His own life. (Location 3363)
- Such expansion of status also provides unlimited opportunity for the inner darkness to reveal itself. The lust for blood, rape and destruction is very much part of power’s attraction. (Location 3374)
- Power also means the capacity to take vengeance, ensure submission, and crush enemies. Grant Cain enough power and he will not only kill Abel. He will torture him, first, imaginatively and endlessly. (Location 3376)

- the difference between moral or narrative truth and objective truth had not yet been fully comprehended (Location 3453)
- The hammer-wielding philosopher mounted an assault on an early-established and then highly influential line of Christian thinking: that Christianity meant accepting the proposition that Christ’s sacrifice, and only that sacrifice, had redeemed humanity. (Location 3463)

- The self is the great actor of evil who strode about the stage of Being as Nazi and Stalinist (Location 3557)

- We can produce abstracted representations of potential modes of Being. (Location 3564)
- We can test it out against our other ideas, the ideas of others, or the world itself. If it falls short, we can let it go. We can, in Popper’s formulation, let our ideas die in our stead.147 (Location 3565)
- Faith in the part of us that continues across those deaths is a prerequisite to thinking itself. (Location 3568)
- an idea is not the same thing as a fact. A fact is something that is dead, in and of itself. It has no consciousness, no will to power, no motivation, no action. There are billions of dead facts. The internet is a graveyard of dead facts. But an idea that grips a person is alive. It wants to express itself, to live in the world. (Location 3569)
- An idea defines figure against ground. An idea is a personality, not a fact. When it manifests itself within a person, it has a strong proclivity to make of that person its avatar: to impel that person to act it out. (Location 3574)
- Sometimes, that impulsion (possession is another word) can be so strong that the person will die, rather than allowing the idea to perish. (Location 3576)

- A guard would force an inmate to carry a hundred-pound sack of wet salt from one side of the large compound to the other—and then to carry it back. Arbeit macht frei, said the sign over the camp entrance—“Work will set you free”—and the freedom was death. Carrying the salt was an act of pointless torment. It was a piece of malevolent art. It allowed me to realize with certainty that some actions are wrong. (Location 3603)
- There are some actions that are so intrinsically terrible that they run counter to the proper nature of human Being. (Location 3609)
- These are evil actions. No excuses are available for engaging in them. (Location 3610)
- To dehumanize a fellow being, to reduce him or her to the status of a parasite, to torture and to slaughter with no consideration of individual innocence or guilt, to make an art form of pain—that is wrong. (Location 3611)
- What can I not doubt? The reality of suffering. (Location 3613)
- Nihilists cannot undermine it with skepticism. Totalitarians cannot banish it. Cynics cannot escape from its reality. Suffering is real, and the artful infliction of suffering on another, for its own sake, is wrong. (Location 3613)
- That became the cornerstone of my belief. (Location 3614)

- reason falls in love with itself, and worse. It falls in love with its own productions. It elevates them, and worships them as absolutes. Lucifer (Location 3942)
- it means denial of the necessity for courageous individual confrontation with Being. (Location 3947)
- What is going to save you? The totalitarian says, in essence, “You must rely on faith in what you already know.” But that is not what saves. What saves is the willingness to learn from what you don’t know. (Location 3947)
- faith in the possibility of human transformation. (Location 3949)
- The American asks, “Why are there no demons here to keep everyone from escaping?” Satan replies, “This is where we put the Russians. If one tries to escape, the others pull him back in.” (Location 3965)
- Satan knows full well that even if he was willing to seek reconciliation, and God willing to grant it, he would only rebel again, because he will not change. (Location 3968)
- Hell Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings A mind not to be changed by Place or Time.151 (Location 3973)
    - Note: Does this concept also connect withthe low crustacean that did nof look at the future or better was not ale to change in par wth nature?
- The idea that hell exists in some metaphysical manner is not only ancient, and pervasive; it’s true. Hell is eternal. It has always existed. It exists now. It’s the most barren, hopeless and malevolent subdivision of the underworld of chaos, where disappointed and resentful people forever dwell. (Location 3978)
- Those who have lied enough, in word and action, live there, in hell—now. (Location 3987)
- It was deceit that almost doomed civilization itself. It is deceit that still threatens us, most profoundly, today. (Location 3994)
    - Note: And I am noexception, every time I heat an opinion I can not stop wondering if it is true o only partially true and is deceiving me. My biggest problem is that I realise it was a deception only when I am able to hear someon else opinion and than I wonder if the last was also a deception and so forth
- An aim reduces anxiety, because if you have no aim everything can mean anything or nothing, and neither of those two options makes for a tranquil spirit. (Location 3999)
- Osiris is tradition, aged and willfully blind. Horus, his son, could and would, by contrast, see. Horus was the god of attention. That is not the same as rationality. Because he paid attention, Horus could perceive and triumph against the evils of Set, (Location 4017)

- culture and its wisdom is additionally vulnerable to corruption—to voluntary, willful blindness and Mephistophelean intrigue. (Location 4026)
- It is our responsibility to see what is before our eyes, courageously, and to learn from it, even if it seems horrible—even if the horror of seeing it damages our consciousness, and half-blinds us. (Location 4028)
- Nietzsche said that a man’s worth was determined by how much truth he could tolerate. (Location 4031)
- You are by no means only what you already know. You are also all that which you could know, if you only would. (Location 4031)
- you should never sacrifice what you could be for what you are. (Location 4032)
- The Logos is the Word of God. (Location 4034)
- Every bit of learning is a little death. Every bit of new information challenges a previous conception, forcing it to dissolve into chaos before it can be reborn as something better. (Location 4037)
- I experience an internal sensation of sinking and division, rather than solidity and strength, when I am incautious with my acts and words. (Location 4050)
- All people serve their ambition. In that matter, there are no atheists. There are only people who know, and don’t know, what God they serve. (Location 4057)
    - Note: After all people who claim to be atheist follow some ideologies or in the best case some morals. This ideas act as their God, no different than Christians or ay religion, they do not follow a God but his word, so who is really an atheist?
- you go to engineering school, because that is what your parents desire—but it is not what you want. Working at cross-purposes to your own wishes, you will find yourself unmotivated, and failing. You will struggle to concentrate and discipline yourself, but it will not work. Your soul will reject the tyranny of your will (how else could that be said?). Why are you complying? You may not want to disappoint your parents (although if you fail you will do exactly that). You may lack the courage for the conflict necessary to free yourself. You may not want to sacrifice your childish belief in parental omniscience, wishing devoutly to continue believing that there is someone who knows you better than you know yourself, and who also knows all about the world. You want to be shielded in this manner from the stark existential aloneness of individual Being and its attendant responsibility. This is all very common and understandable. But you suffer because you are truly not meant to be an engineer. One day you have had enough. You drop out. You disappoint your parents. You learn to live with that. You consult only yourself, even though that means you must rely on your own decisions. You take a philosophy degree. You accept the burden of your own mistakes. You become your own person. By rejecting your father’s vision, you develop your own. And then, as your parents age, you’ve become adult enough to be there for them, when they come to need you. They win, too. But both victories had to be purchased at the cost of the conflict engendered by your truth. (Location 4063)
- “Act diligently towards some well-articulated, defined and temporary end. Make your criteria for failure and success timely and clear, at least for yourself (and even better if others can understand what you are doing and evaluate it with you). While doing so, however, allow the world and your spirit to unfold as they will, while you act out and articulate the truth.” (Location 4092)
- It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. (Location 4104)
- we speed the natural deterioration of great things through blindness, inaction and deceit. Without attention, culture degenerates and dies, and evil prevails. (Location 4118)
- A lie is connected to everything else. It produces the same effect on the world that a single drop of sewage produces in even the largest crystal magnum of champagne. It is something best considered live and growing. (Location 4120)
- if you look close enough, the biggest of lies is composed of smaller lies, and those are composed of still smaller lies—and the smallest of lies is where the big lie starts. (Location 4122)
- Lies corrupt the world. Worse, that is their intent. (Location 4127)
- If you don’t believe in brick walls, you will still be injured when you run headlong into one. Then you will curse reality itself for producing the wall. (Location 4131)
- Finally, there is the proposition: “Being itself is susceptible to my manipulations. Thus, it deserves no respect.” (Location 4134)
- Hell comes when lies have destroyed the relationship between individual or state and reality itself. (Location 4138)

- Truth reduces the terrible complexity of a man to the simplicity of his word, so that he can become a partner, rather than an enemy. (Location 4147)
- Truth makes the past truly past, and makes the best use of the future’s possibilities. (Location 4148)
    - Note: Think about how much resentment you hold in yourself
- If your life is not what it could be, try telling the truth. If you cling desperately to an ideology, or wallow in nihilism, try telling the truth. If you feel weak and rejected, and desperate, and confused, try telling the truth. In Paradise, everyone speaks the truth. That is what makes it Paradise. Tell the truth. Or, at least, don’t lie. (Location 4157)
- Psychotherapy is not advice. Advice is what you get when the person you’re talking with about something horrible and complicated wishes you would just shut up and go away. (Location 4166)
- If you weren’t so stupid, after all, you wouldn’t have your stupid problems. (Location 4168)
- Psychotherapy is genuine conversation. Genuine conversation is exploration, articulation and strategizing. (Location 4169)
- Sometimes if you listen to people they will even tell you what’s wrong with them. Sometimes they will even tell you how they plan to fix it. Sometimes that helps you fix something wrong with yourself. (Location 4171)
- Many of the people I listen to have no one else to talk to. Some of them are truly alone in the world. There are far more people like that than you think. You don’t meet them, because they are alone. (Location 4177)
- Alcohol can cause ambiguity. That’s partly why people drink. Alcohol temporarily lifts the terrible burden of self-consciousness from people. Drunk people know about the future, but they don’t care about it. That’s exciting. (Location 4185)

- You can’t fix a car with an axe, but you can cut down a tree. That’s still something. (Location 4217)
- I understood much more clearly and precisely, however, how easy it might be to instill a false memory into the mental landscape as soon as my client revealed her uncertainty about her sexual experiences. (Location 4222)
- The present can change the past, and the future can change the present. (Location 4230)
- therapists with a little second-hand knowledge of Freud often axiomatically assume that a distressed adult in their practice must have been subject to childhood sexual abuse. Why else would they be distressed? So, they dig, and infer, and intimate, and suggest, and overreact, and bias and tilt. They exaggerate the importance of some events, and downplay the importance of others. They trim the facts to fit their theory.158 And they convince their clients that they were sexually abused—if they could only remember. And then the clients start to remember. And then they start to accuse. And sometimes what they remember never happened, and the people accused are innocent. (Location 4240)
- people are often willing to produce a lot of collateral damage if they can retain their theory. (Location 4247)
- if you’re not the leading man in your own drama, you’re a bit player in someone else’s—and you might well be assigned to play a dismal, lonely and tragic part. (Location 4250)
- Memory is not a description of the objective past. Memory is a tool. Memory is the past’s guide to the future. If you remember that something bad happened, and you can figure out why, then you can try to avoid that bad thing happening again. That’s the purpose of memory. It’s not “to remember the past.” It’s to stop the same damn thing from happening over and over. (Location 4259)
- could have told her, in more philosophical terms, that she was Nietzsche’s “pale criminal”—the person who at one moment dares to break the sacred law and at the next shrinks from paying the price. (Location 4270)
- Life is very complicated. Sometimes you have to change the way you understand everything to properly understand a single something. (Location 4278)
- If you cut off the head of a hydra, seven more grow. That’s life. (Location 4283)
    - Note: Is it really? All this intellectuas seems to me like they instead have the answers that I do not have and have clarity like the cut down all the heads or got to the heart that keep all af them alive
- But at least she didn’t leave as the living embodiment of my damned ideology. (Location 4285)
- People think they think, but it’s not true. It’s mostly self-criticism that passes for thinking. True thinking is rare—just like true listening. Thinking is listening to yourself. It’s difficult. To think, you have to be at least two people at the same time. Then you have to let those people disagree. Thinking is an internal dialogue between two or more different views of the world. (Location 4297)
- You can’t set straw men against one another when you’re thinking, either, because then you’re not thinking. You’re rationalizing, post-hoc. You’re matching what you want against a weak opponent so that you don’t have to change your mind. (Location 4301)
- In consequence, thinking is emotionally painful, as well as physiologically demanding; (Location 4309)
    - Note: You have to process sooooo much, which is the challenging memtally part, and than you have to kill something at the end
- What are you to do, then, if you aren’t very good at thinking, at being two people at one time? That’s easy. You talk. But you need someone to listen. A listening person is your collaborator and your opponent. (Location 4311)
- by no means always right, but it’s commonly right. It’s typically right. (Location 4314)
- But something new and radical is still almost always wrong. You need good, even great, reasons to ignore or defy general, public opinion. (Location 4317)
- you’re going to insist on bending the world to your way, you better have your reasons. If you’re going to stand your ground, you better have your reasons. You better have thought them through. You might otherwise be in for a very hard landing. (Location 4321)
- A listening person can reflect the crowd. He can do that without talking. He can do that merely by letting the talking person listen to himself. That is what Freud recommended. (Location 4326)
- That’s his method of free association. (Location 4327)
- It was for such reasons, as well, that Freud insisted that psychoanalysts be analyzed themselves. (Location 4332)
    - Note: He seems very Fruidian at this point
- Freud had a point. He was, after all, a genius. You can tell that because people still hate him. (Location 4334)
- Many of those who seek therapy desire and need a closer, more personal relationship (although that also has its dangers). This is in part why I have opted in my practice for the conversation, (Location 4335)
- My clients and I face each other. We make eye contact. We can see each other’s expressions. They can observe the effects of their words on me, and I can observe the effects of mine on them. (Location 4343)
- A client of mine might say, “I hate my wife.” It’s out there, once said. It’s hanging in the air. It has emerged from the underworld, materialized from chaos, and manifested itself. It is perceptible and concrete and no longer easily ignored. It’s become real. The speaker has even startled himself. He sees the same thing reflected in my eyes. He notes that, and continues on the road to sanity. “Hold it,” he says. “Back up. That’s too harsh. Sometimes I hate my wife. I hate her when she won’t tell me what she wants. My mom did that all the time, too. It drove Dad crazy. It drove all of us crazy, to tell you the truth. It even drove Mom crazy! She was a nice person, but she was very resentful. Well, at least my wife isn’t as bad as my mother. Not at all. Wait! I guess my wife is actually pretty good at telling me what she wants, but I get really bothered when she doesn’t, because Mom tortured us all half to death being a martyr. That really affected me. Maybe I overreact now when it happens even a bit. Hey! I’m acting just like Dad did when Mom upset him! That isn’t me. That doesn’t have anything to do with my wife! I better let her know.” (Location 4345)
- You can be pretty smart if you can just shut up. (Location 4356)
- A good therapist will tell you the truth about what he thinks. (That is not the same thing as telling you that what he thinks is the truth.) (Location 4366)
- That’s key to the psychotherapeutic process: two people tell each other the truth—and both listen. (Location 4368)
- “The great majority of us cannot listen; we find ourselves compelled to evaluate, because listening is too dangerous. The first requirement is courage, and we do not always have it.”159 (Location 4370)
- ‘Each person can speak up for himself only after he has first restated the ideas and feelings of the previous speaker accurately, and to that speaker’s satisfaction.’ (Location 4376)
- I routinely summarize what people have said to me, and ask them if I have understood properly. (Location 4377)
- you run the risk of being changed yourself. You might see it his way, you might find yourself influenced in your attitudes or personality. This risk of being changed is one of the most frightening prospects most of us can face.” (Location 4382)
- That’s a successful memory. That’s the purpose of memory. You remember the past not so that it is “accurately recorded,” to say it again, but so that you are prepared for the future. (Location 4390)
- If you first give the devil his due, looking at his arguments from his perspective, you can (1) find the value in them, and learn something in the process, or (2) hone your positions against them (if (Location 4396)
- talking (and thinking) is often more about forgetting than about remembering. To discuss an event, particularly something emotional, like a death or serious illness, is to slowly choose what to leave behind. (Location 4402)
- If you listen, instead, without premature judgment, people will generally tell you everything they are thinking—and with very little deceit. People will tell you the most amazing, absurd, interesting things. (Location 4410)
- (You can in fact tell whether or not you are actually listening in this manner. If the conversation is boring, you probably aren’t.) (Location 4412)
- Not all talking is thinking. Nor does all listening foster transformation. (Location 4413)
- There is the conversation, for example, where one participant is speaking merely to establish or confirm his place in the dominance hierarchy. (Location 4415)
- There is another, closely allied form of conversation, where neither speaker is listening in the least to the other. (Location 4421)
- Then there is the conversation where one participant is trying to attain victory for his point of view. (Location 4426)
- denigrate or ridicule the viewpoint of anyone holding a contrary position, (2) use selective evidence while doing so and, finally, (3) impress the listeners (Location 4428)
- Thus, the purpose of the conversation is to make the case that not thinking is the correct tack. The person who is speaking in this manner believes that winning the argument makes him right, (Location 4430)
- Almost all discussions involving politics or economics unfold in this manner, (Location 4434)
- is for this reason that conservatives and liberals alike believe their positions to be self-evident, (Location 4435)
- people organize their brains with conversation. If they don’t have anyone to tell their story to, they lose their minds. (Location 4441)
- To put it another way: It takes a village to organize a mind. (Location 4443)
- We outsource the problem of our sanity. This is why it is the fundamental responsibility of parents to render their children socially acceptable. (Location 4445)
- Men and women often misunderstand each other when these conversations are focused on a specified problem. Men are often accused of wanting to “fix things” too early on in a discussion. This frustrates men, who like to solve problems and to do it efficiently and who are in fact called upon frequently by women for precisely that purpose. (Location 4451)
- Women are often intent on formulating the problem when they are discussing something, and they need to be listened to—even questioned—to help ensure clarity in the formulation. Then, whatever problem is left, if any, can be helpfully solved. (Location 4455)
- too-early problem-solving may also merely indicate a desire to escape from the effort of the problem-formulating conversation.) (Location 4457)
- Another conversational variant is the lecture. A lecture is—somewhat surprisingly—a conversation. (Location 4458)
- A good lecturer is thus talking with and not at or even to his or her listeners. (Location 4466)
- this cannot be done by watching the audience, as such. A good lecturer speaks directly to and watches the response of single, identifiable people,fn2 (Location 4468)
- There is also no “audience.” There are individuals, who need to be included in the conversation. (Location 4472)
- These also have a dominance element, but the goal is to be the most entertaining speaker (which is an accomplishment that everyone participating will also enjoy). (Location 4476)
- The final type of conversation, akin to listening, is a form of mutual exploration. (Location 4499)
- Everyone participating is trying to solve a problem, instead of insisting on the a priori validity of their own positions. (Location 4501)
- This kind of conversation constitutes active philosophy, the highest form of thought, and the best preparation for proper living. (Location 4503)
- They also must have inverted, at least temporarily, the typical human preference for order over chaos (Location 4506)
- The conversation of mutual exploration, by contrast, requires people who have decided that the unknown makes a better friend than the known. (Location 4508)
- You must assume that they have reached careful, thoughtful, genuine conclusions (and, (Location 4517)
- You must believe that if they shared their conclusions with you, you could bypass at least some of the pain of personally learning the same things (as (Location 4518)
- It’s as if you are listening to yourself during such a conversation, just as you are listening to the other person. (Location 4523)
- You are reporting what that information has done to you—what new things it made appear within you, how it has changed your presuppositions, how it has made you think of new questions. You tell the speaker these things, directly. Then they have the same effect on him. In this manner, you both move towards somewhere newer and broader and better. (Location 4524)
- A conversation such as this is one where it is the desire for truth itself—on the part of both participants—that is truly listening and speaking. (Location 4527)
- You’re where you should be, with one foot in order, and the other tentatively extended into chaos and the unknown. (Location 4529)
- There the constituent elements of your Being can find their more elegant formation. (Location 4532)
- Your wisdom then consists not of the knowledge you already have, but the continual search for knowledge, which is the highest form of wisdom. (Location 4536)
- It is for this reason that the priestess of the Delphic Oracle in ancient Greece spoke most highly of Socrates, who always sought the truth. She described him as the wisest living man, because he knew that what he knew was nothing. (Location 4537)
- It’s because of the nature of our perceptions themselves, and the oft-invisible interaction between those perceptions and the underlying complexity of the world. (Location 4554)
- To put it another way: What you perceive as your computer is like a single leaf, on a tree, in a forest—or, even more accurately, like your fingers rubbing briefly across that leaf. A single leaf can be plucked from a branch. It can be perceived, briefly, as a single, self-contained entity—but that perception misleads more than clarifies. (Location 4569)
- Almost everything we see and hold is like that, although often not so evidently. (Location 4575)
- Our evolved perceptual systems transform the interconnected, complex multi-level world that we inhabit not so much into things per se as into useful things (or their nemeses, things that get in the way). (Location 4577)
- This is the transformation of the near-infinite complexity of things through the narrow specification of our purpose. (Location 4579)
- We see tools and obstacles, not objects or things. (Location 4585)
- When we look at the world, we perceive only what is enough for our plans and actions to work and for us to get by. What we inhabit, then, is this “enough.” (Location 4593)
- It is for this reason that we must be precise in our aim. Absent that, we drown in the complexity of the world. (Location 4598)
    - Note: This is very related also to the concept of bounds to be free. You need this bounds and definitions to be able to actually make free choices or male choices at all for that matter
- Is our father or son or wife or husband more or less integral to us than an arm or a leg? We can answer, in part, by asking: Which we rather lose? Which loss would we sacrifice more to avoid? (Location 4610)
- To the degree that we are patriotic, similarly, our country is not just important to us. It is us. We might even sacrifice our entire smaller individual selves, in battle, to maintain the integrity of our country. (Location 4625)
    - Note: Sounds a bit like a recipee for another totalitarian regeeme to me
- A car, as we perceive it, is not a thing, or an object. It is instead something that takes us somewhere we want to go. It is only when it stops taking us and going, in fact, that we perceive it much at all. (Location 4641)
    - Note: Sounds also a lot like the common phrase that you only appreciate what you have once you lose it
- This all means that the failure of our car can also force us to confront the uncertainty of the broader social context, which is usually invisible to us, in which the machine (and mechanic) are mere parts. (Location 4650)
- The limitations of all our perceptions of things and selves manifest themselves when something we can usually depend on in our simplified world breaks down. (Location 4654)
- When things are no longer specified, with precision, the walls crumble, and chaos makes its presence known. When we’ve been careless, and let things slide, what we have refused to attend to gathers itself up, adopts a serpentine form, and strikes—often at the worst possible moment. It is then that we see what focused intent, precision of aim and careful attention protects us from. (Location 4658)
- Her husband is not who she perceived him to be—but neither is she, the betrayed wife. She is no longer the “well-loved, secure wife, and valued partner.” (Location 4668)
- The past is not necessarily what it was, even though it has already been. The present is chaotic and indeterminate. The ground shifts continually around her feet, and ours. Equally, the future, not yet here, changes into something it was not supposed to be. (Location 4670)
- Emergency—emergence(y). This is the sudden manifestation from somewhere unknown of some previously unknown phenomenon (Location 4693)
- This is perception before the chaos of possibility is re-articulated into the functional realities of order. (Location 4719)
- She remembers when she first married, eagerly joining her husband, every single night, to make love. Perhaps that was too much to expect—or even too much to cope with—but once, in the last six months? Once every two or three months, for years, before that? Would anyone she could truly respect—including herself—put up with such a situation? (Location 4721)
- Maybe! That’s the moral of many, many stories. Chaos emerges in a household, bit by bit. Mutual unhappiness and resentment pile up. Everything untidy is swept under the rug, where the dragon feasts on the crumbs. (Location 4735)
    - Note: This is me ad my resentment probably. This is likelywhat happens to me when I make friends or in a relashionsip and why everyone become so annoying after a while, it's not them it's me, or betfer my inability to say and face prblems when they arise, at that point the resentmet grow like the dragon
- Communication would require admission of terrible emotions: resentment, terror, loneliness, despair, jealousy, frustration, hatred, boredom. Moment by moment, it’s easier to keep the peace. But in the background, in Billy Bixbee’s house, and in all that are like it, the dragon grows. (Location 4738)
- Don’t ever underestimate the destructive power of sins of omission. (Location 4745)
    - Note: In fhat frontI am matural calamity than...
- In many households, in recent decades, the traditional household division of labour has been demolished, not least in the name of liberation and freedom. That demolition, however, has not left so much glorious lack of restriction in its wake as chaos, conflict and indeterminacy. (Location 4748)
- the absence of agreed-upon tradition (and the constraints—often uncomfortable; often even unreasonable—that it imposes) there exist only three difficult options: slavery, tyranny or negotiation. (Location 4750)
- negotiation—that requires forthright admission on the part of both players that the dragon exists. That’s a reality difficult to face, even when it’s still too small to simply devour the knight who dares confront it. (Location 4755)
- Maybe they could have done that instead of saying, in the agreeable, lazy and cowardly way: “It’s OK. It’s not worth fighting about.” There is little, in a marriage, that is so little that it is not worth fighting about. (Location 4758)
    - Note: This is for marriage not for everyday relations with people, that is a bit different
- Under such circumstances, there is nothing but a fight—a fight with peace as the goal—that will reveal the truth. But you remain silent, and you convince yourself it’s because you are a good, peace-loving, patient person (and nothing could be further from the truth). And the monster under the rug gains a few more pounds. (Location 4766)

- Having the argument necessary to solve a real problem therefore necessitates willingness to confront two forms of miserable and dangerous potential simultaneously: chaos (the potential fragility of the relationship—of all relationships—of life itself) and Hell (the fact that you—and your partner—could each be the person bad enough to ruin everything with your laziness and spite). There’s every motivation to avoid. (Location 4806)
- Why remain vague, when it renders life stagnant and murky? Well, if you don’t know who you are, you can hide in doubt. (Location 4810)
- Why refuse to investigate, when knowledge of reality enables mastery of reality (Location 4814)
- If you wait instead until what you are refusing to investigate comes a-knocking at your door, things will certainly not go so well for you. (Location 4820)
- What you least want to encounter will make itself manifest when you are weakest and it is strongest. And you will be defeated. (Location 4822)
    - Note: The true fight is in the preparation
- Why refuse to specify, when specifying the problem would enable its solution? Because to specify the problem is to admit that it exists. Because to specify the problem is to allow yourself to know what you want, say, from friend or lover—and then you will know, precisely and cleanly, when you don’t get it, and that will hurt, sharply and specifically. (Location 4833)
- If we speak carefully and precisely, we can sort things out, and put them in their proper place, and set a new goal, and navigate to it—often communally, if we negotiate; (Location 4877)
- The psyche (the soul) and the world are both organized, at the highest levels of human existence, with language, through communication. (Location 4881)
- When something goes wrong, even perception itself must be questioned, along with evaluation, thought and action. (Location 4883)

- I have seen university students, particularly those in the humanities, suffer genuine declines in their mental health from being philosophically berated by such defenders of the planet for their existence as members of the human species. It’s worse, I think, for young men. As privileged beneficiaries of the patriarchy, their accomplishments are considered unearned. As possible adherents of rape culture, they’re sexually suspect. Their ambitions make them plunderers of the planet. They’re not welcome. At the junior high, high school and university level, they’re falling behind educationally. (Location 5157)
- In modern universities women now make up more than 50 percent of the students in more than two-thirds of all disciplines. Boys are suffering, in the modern world. They are more disobedient—negatively—or more independent—positively—than girls, and they suffer for this, throughout their pre-university educational career. (Location 5164)

It isn’t. This isn’t a debate. The data are in.175 (Location 5171)
- Boys like competition, and they don’t like to obey, particularly when they are adolescents. During that time, they are driven to escape their families, and establish their own independent existence. There is little difference between doing that and challenging authority. Schools, which were set up in the late 1800s precisely to inculcate obedience,176 do not take kindly to provocative and daring behaviour, no matter how tough-minded and competent it might show a boy (or a girl) to be. (Location 5174)
- Girls will, for example, play boys’ games, but boys are much more reluctant to play girls’ games. This is in part because it is admirable for a girl to win when competing with a boy. It is also OK for her to lose to a boy. For a boy to beat a girl, however, it is often not OK—and just as often, it is even less OK for him to lose. (Location 5178)

- Girls can win by winning in their own hierarchy—by being good at what girls value, as girls. They can add to this victory by winning in the boys’ hierarchy. Boys, however, can only win by winning in the male hierarchy. They will lose status, among girls and boys, by being good at what girls value. It costs them in reputation among the boys, and in attractiveness among the girls. (Location 5182)
- Boys can’t (won’t) play truly competitive games with girls. It isn’t clear how they can win. As the game turns into a girls’ game, therefore, the boys leave. Are the universities—particularly the humanities—about to become a girls’ game? Is this what we want? (Location 5187)
- If you eliminate the so-called STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) programs (excluding psychology), the female/male ratio is even more skewed.178 Almost 80 percent of students majoring in the fields of healthcare, public administration, psychology and education, which comprise one-quarter of all degrees, are female. The disparity is still rapidly increasing. (Location 5191)

- According to Derrida, hierarchical structures emerged only to include (the beneficiaries of that structure) and to exclude (everyone else, who were therefore oppressed). Even that claim wasn’t sufficiently radical. Derrida claimed that divisiveness and oppression were built right into language—built into the very categories we use to pragmatically simplify and negotiate the world. There are “women” only because men gain by excluding them. (Location 5383)
- Science only benefits the scientists. Politics only benefits the politicians. In Derrida’s view, hierarchies exist because they gain from oppressing those who are omitted. (Location 5388)
- Despite the existence of an overwhelming, multi-disciplinary scientific literature indicating that sex differences are powerfully influenced by biological factors, science is just another game of power, for Derrida and his post-modern Marxist acolytes, making claims to benefit those at the pinnacle of the scientific world.

- Now, I have some beliefs that might be regarded as left-leaning. I think, for example, that the tendency for valuable goods to distribute themselves with pronounced inequality constitutes an ever-present threat to the stability of society. I think there is good evidence for that. That does not mean that the solution to the problem is self-evident. We don’t know how to redistribute wealth without introducing a whole host of other problems. (Location 5412)

Such people have a perfect right to their opinions and actions, if they remain lawful. But they have no reasonable claim to public funding. If radical right-wingers were receiving state funding for political operations disguised as university courses, as the radical left-wingers clearly are, the uproar from progressives across North America would be deafening.

- Thus, the order of logic is reversed, so that the ideology can be camouflaged. The fact that such statements lead immediately to internal inconsistencies within the ideology is never addressed. Gender is constructed, but an individual who desires gender re-assignment surgery is to be unarguably considered a man trapped in a woman’s body (or vice versa). The fact that both of these cannot logically be true, simultaneously, is just ignored (Location 5458)
- The introduction of the “equal pay for equal work” argument immediately complicates even salary comparison beyond practicality, for one simple reason: who decides what work is equal? It’s not possible. That’s why the marketplace exists. Worse is the problem of group comparison: women should make as much as men. OK. Black women should make as much as white women. OK. Should salary then be adjusted for all parameters of race? At what level of resolution? What racial categories are “real”? (Location 5466)
- Disabled people should make as much as non-disabled people. OK. On the surface, that’s a noble, compassionate, fair claim. But who is disabled? Is someone living with a parent with Alzheimer’s disabled? If not, why not? What about someone with a lower IQ? Someone less attractive? Someone overweight? Some people clearly move through life markedly overburdened with problems that are beyond their control, but it is a rare person indeed who isn’t suffering from at least one serious catastrophe at any given time—particularly if you include their family in the equation. And why shouldn’t you? Here’s the fundamental problem: group identity can be fractionated right down to the level of the individual. (Location 5473)
- What such studies imply is that we could probably minimize the innate differences between boys and girls, if we were willing to exert enough pressure. This would in no way ensure that we were freeing people of either gender to make their own choices. But choice has no place in the ideological picture: if men and women act, voluntarily, to produce gender-unequal outcomes, those very choices must have been determined by cultural bias.

- It might mean gathering some evidence, strategically, so that when you confront that person, you can give them several examples of their misbehaviour (at least three), so they can’t easily weasel out of your accusations. It might mean failing to concede when they offer you their counterarguments. People rarely have more than four at hand. If you remain unmoved, they get angry, or cry, or run away. It’s very useful to attend to tears in such situations. They can be used to motivate guilt on the part of the accuser due, theoretically, to having caused hurt feelings and pain. But tears are often shed in anger. A red face is a good cue. If you can push your point past the first four responses and stand fast against the consequent emotion, you will gain your target’s attention—and, perhaps, their respect. (Location 5537)

She was a fair distance away, about thirty yards, but I could immediately see by the change in her body language that she knew what was going on. Of course, the other kids saw her as well. She walked right by. I knew that hurt her. Part of her was worried that I would come home with a bloody nose and a black eye. It would have been easy enough for her just to yell, “Hey, you kids, quit that!” or even to come over and interfere. But she didn’t. A few years later, when I was having teenage trouble with my dad, my mom said, “If it was too good at home, you’d never leave.” (Location 5653)

- As I sat with my client—as she discussed her husband’s advancing illness—we discussed the fragility of life, the catastrophe of existence, and the sense of nihilism evoked by the spectre of death. (Location 5886)
- Imagine a Being who is omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent. What does such a Being lack?211 The answer? Limitation. If you are already everything, everywhere, always, there is nowhere to go and nothing to be. (Location 5890)
- it is for this reason, so the story goes, that God created man. No limitation, no story. No story, no Being. That idea has helped me deal with the terrible fragility of Being. (Location 5893)
    - Note: So he also think that it really is as simple as the possibility to loose something os what makes ig enjoyable and beautiful
- existence and limitation are inextricably linked. (Location 5896)
- Though thirty spokes may form the wheel, it is the hole within the hub which gives the wheel utility. It is not the clay the potter throws, which gives the pot its usefulness, but the space within the shape, from which the pot is made. Without a door, the room cannot be entered, and without its windows it is dark Such is the utility of non-existence.212 (Location 5898)
- A superhero who can do anything turns out to be no hero at all. He’s nothing specific, so he’s nothing. He has nothing to strive against, so he can’t be admirable. Being of any reasonable sort appears to require limitation. Perhaps this is because Being requires Becoming, perhaps, as well as mere static existence—and to become is to become something more, or at least something different. That is only possible for something limited. (Location 5934)
- it would be better not to be at all. Perhaps it would be even better if there was no Being at all. But people who come to the former conclusion are flirting with suicide, and those who come to the latter with something worse, something truly monstrous. They’re consorting with the idea of the destruction of everything. They are toying with genocide—and (Location 5955)
- And what is truly horrifying is that such conclusions are understandable, maybe even inevitable—although not inevitably acted upon. (Location 5957)
- them (if not the thoughts themselves) inevitably serve to make a bad situation even worse. Hating life, despising life—even for the genuine pain that life inflicts—merely serves to make life itself worse, unbearably worse. There is no genuine protest in that. There is no goodness in that, only the desire to produce suffering, for the sake of suffering. (Location 5961)
- I also don’t think it is possible to answer the question by thinking. Thinking leads inexorably to the abyss. It did not work for Tolstoy. It might not even have worked for Nietzsche, who arguably thought more clearly about such things than anyone in history. (Location 5970)
- Something supersedes thinking, despite its truly awesome power. When existence reveals itself as existentially intolerable, thinking collapses in on itself. In such situations—in the depths—it’s noticing, not thinking, that does the trick. Perhaps you might start by noticing this: when you love someone, it’s not despite their limitations. It’s because of their limitations. (Location 5974)
- You shouldn’t stop trying to make life better, or let suffering just be. But there appear to be limits on the path to improvement beyond which we might not want to go, lest we sacrifice our humanity itself. (Location 5977)
- During much of this period, we were overwhelmed. The demands of everyday life don’t stop, just because you have been laid low by a catastrophe. Everything that you always do still has to be done. So how do you manage? Here are some things we learned: Set aside some time to talk and to think about the illness or other crisis and how it should be managed every day. Do not talk or think about it otherwise. If you do not limit its effect, you will become exhausted, and everything will spiral into the ground. This is not helpful. Conserve your strength. You’re in a war, not a battle, and a war is composed of many battles. You must stay functional through all of them. When worries associated with the crisis arise at other times, remind yourself that you will think them through, during the scheduled period. This usually works. The parts of your brain that generate anxiety are more interested in the fact that there is a plan than in the details of the plan. Don’t schedule your time to think in the evening or at night. Then you won’t be able to sleep. If you can’t sleep, then everything will go rapidly downhill. Shift the unit of time you use to frame your life. When the sun is shining, and times are good, and the crops are bountiful, you can make your plans for the next month, and the next year, and the next five years. You can even dream a decade ahead. But you can’t do that when your leg is clamped firmly in a crocodile’s jaws. (Location 6027)
- Christ enjoins His followers to place faith in God’s Heavenly Kingdom, and the truth. That’s a conscious decision to presume the primary goodness of Being. That’s an act of courage. Aim high, like Pinocchio’s Geppetto. (Location 6041)
- Be careful. Put the things you can control in order. Repair what is in disorder, and make what is already good better. It is possible that you can manage, if you are careful. People are very tough. People can survive through much pain and loss. But to persevere they must see the good in Being. If they lose that, they are truly lost. (Location 6043)
- To me, cats are a manifestation of nature, of Being, in an almost pure form. Furthermore, they are a form of Being that looks at human beings and approves. (Location 6051)
- If you pay careful attention, even on a bad day, you may be fortunate enough to be confronted with small opportunities of just that sort. (Location 6064)
- Personally, I like to watch a Simpsons episode at 1.5 times regular speed: all the laughs; two-thirds the time. (Location 6067)
- maybe when you are going for a walk and your head is spinning a cat will show up and if you pay attention to it then you will get a reminder for just fifteen seconds that the wonder of Being might make up for the ineradicable suffering that accompanies it. Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street. (Location 6068)
- Perhaps you could ask, instead, what you might have to do right now to increase your resolve, buttress your character, and find the strength to go on. Perhaps you could instead ask to see the truth. (Location 6098)
- Alone, trying to calm down, we would each ask ourselves the same single question: What had we each done to contribute to the situation we were arguing about? However small, however distant ... we had each made some error. (Location 6105)
- Here’s how I was wrong .... The problem with asking yourself such a question is that you must truly want the answer. And the problem with doing that is that you won’t like the answer. (Location 6107)
- you must decide whether you want to be right or you want to have peace.216 (Location 6114)
- You don’t get peace by being right. You just get to be right, while your partner gets to be wrong—defeated and wrong. Do that ten thousand times and your marriage will be over (Location 6116)
- I was genuinely thinking—or listening, in the sense described in Rule 9 (Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don’t). That rule can apply as much to yourself as to others. It was me, of course, who asked the question—and it was me, of course, who replied. But those two me’s were not the same. (Location 6129)
    - Note: Maybe this is how I should approach my block when I try to come up with something
- What shall I do with my life? Aim for Paradise, and concentrate on today. Hah! I knew what that meant. It’s what Geppetto does in the Disney movie Pinocchio, when he wishes upon a star. (Location 6144)
- Orient yourself properly. Then—and only then—concentrate on the day. Set your sights at the Good, the Beautiful, and the True, and then focus pointedly and carefully on the concerns of each moment. (Location 6155)
- What shall I do with my wife? Treat her as if she is the Holy Mother of God, so that she may give birth to the world-redeeming hero. What shall I do with my daughter? Stand behind her, listen to her, guard her, train her mind, and let her know it’s OK if she wants to be a mother. What shall I do with my parents? Act such that your actions justify the suffering they endured. What shall I do with my son? Encourage him to be a true Son of God. To honour your wife as a Mother of God is to notice and support the sacred element of her role as mother (Location 6159)
- It’s not for nothing that the Holy Mother and Infant is a divine image—as we just discussed. Societies that cease to honour that image—that cease to see that relationship as of transcendent and fundamental importance—also cease to be. (Location 6173)
- To encourage my son to be a true Son of God? That is to want him above all to do what is right, and to strive to have his back while he is doing so. (Location 6178)
- What shall I do with the stranger? Invite him into my house, and treat him like a brother, so that he may become one. That’s to extend the hand of trust to someone so that his or her best part can step forward and reciprocate. (Location 6182)
- What shall I do with a torn nation? Stitch it back together with careful words of truth. (Location 6191)
- What shall I do for God my Father? Sacrifice everything I hold dear to yet greater perfection. (Location 6196)
- A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them (Location 6201)
- How shall I deal with the enlightened one? Replace him with the true seeker of enlightenment. There is no enlightened one. There is only the one who is seeking further enlightenment. Proper Being is process, not a state; (Location 6205)
- What shall I do when I despise what I have? Remember those who have nothing and strive to be grateful. (Location 6210)
- He who has many material things, may be described as rich, but he who knows he has enough, and is at one with the Tao, might have enough of material things and have self-being as well.218 (Location 6228)
- To give is to do what you can to make things better. The good in people will respond to that, and support it, and imitate it, and multiply it, and return it, and foster it, so that everything improves and moves forward. (Location 6240)
- is better, proverbially, to rule your own spirit than to rule a city. (Location 6245)
- What shall I do when my enemy succeeds? Aim a little higher and be grateful for the lesson. (Location 6248)
- Learn, from the success of your enemies; listen (Rule 9) to their critique, so that you can glean from their opposition whatever fragments of wisdom you might incorporate, to your betterment; (Location 6252)
- What shall I do when I’m tired and impatient? Gratefully accept an outstretched helping hand. (Location 6255)
- What shall I do with the fact of aging? Replace the potential of my youth with the accomplishments of my maturity. (Location 6259)
- What shall I do with my infant’s death? Hold my other loved ones and heal their pain. It is necessary to be strong in the face of death, because death is intrinsic to life. It is for this reason that I tell my students: aim to be the person at your father’s funeral that everyone, in their grief and misery, can rely on. (Location 6265)
- That means I am likely to see my parents, if I am fortunate, fewer than twenty more times. That’s a terrible thing to know. But knowing it puts a stop to my taking those opportunities for granted. (Location 6284)
- Your inaction, inertia and cynicism removes from the world that part of you that could learn to quell suffering and make peace. That’s not good. (Location 6290)
- And I have learned through painful experience that nothing is going so badly that it can’t be made worse. This is why Hell is a bottomless pit. This is why Hell is associated with that aforementioned sin. (Location 6295)
- What shall I do with the most difficult of questions? Consider them the gateway to the path of life. (Location 6304)
- hope, in accordance with Rule 11 (Do not bother children when they are skateboarding), that you strengthen and encourage those who are committed to your care instead of protecting them to the point of weakness. (Location 6311)
- Being (with a capital “B”) is what each of us experiences, subjectively, personally and individually, as well as what we each experience jointly with others. As such, it includes emotions, drives, dreams, visions and revelations, as well as our private thoughts and perceptions. Being is also, finally, something that is brought into existence by action, so its nature is to an indeterminate degree a consequence of our decisions and choices—something shaped by our hypothetically free will. Construed in this manner, Being is (1) not something easily and directly reducible to the material and objective and (2) something that most definitely requires its own term, (Location 6928)
