- Summary: A group of researchers have discovered two major flaws in computer processors that could allow hackers to steal sensitive data such as passwords and encryption keys. The flaws, called Meltdown and Spectre, affect nearly all computers and mobile devices, including those using chips from Intel, AMD and ARM. Meltdown affects only Intel chips and allows hackers to bypass the hardware barrier between applications run by users and the computer's core memory. Spectre, which is harder to exploit but also more difficult to mitigate, affects all chips and allows hackers to trick applications into giving up secret information.

## Highlights
- Rather than wasting these cycles by idling, the CPU attempts to guess the direction of control flow, saves a checkpoint of its register state, and proceeds to speculatively execute the program on the guessed path.
- If the guess was wrong, the CPU discards the incorrect speculative execution by reverting the register state
- Since their introduction in the late 90â€™s [43], many physical effects such as power consumption [41, 42], electromagnetic radiation [58], or acoustic noise [20] have been leveraged to extract cryptographic keys as well as other secrets.
- As the effects of these instructions on the nominal CPU state are eventually
- reverted, we call them transient instructions.
