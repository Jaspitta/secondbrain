- y1 =4.
- If instead you choose to have the subscript n start from 0, then the closed form is yn = arn (n =0, 1, 2,...).
### 3 Graphs andlong-term behaviour
#### 3.1Graphs of sequences
- .You canthink of any sequence as a function whose domain is the set of natural numbers {1, 2, 3,...}.
- In general, the sequence(xn)∞ n=1 deﬁnesa function forwhich each input number n gives the output xn,
- , the graphofthe sequence consists of points thatlie on astraightline
- In each case,the graphconsists of points that lie on the graphofanexponential growthordecayfunction.
