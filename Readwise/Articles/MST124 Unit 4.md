- Summary: The sine, cosine, and tangent are trigonometric functions that relate to the angles of right-angled triangles. These functions can be defined for any angle, including negative angles, by associating each angle with a point on the unit circle. The sine rule helps to find the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles, making it easier to solve problems in trigonometry.

## Highlights
- . Atypical problemin trigonometryrequiresyou to calculateone of the side lengths or anglesofa triangle from otherinformation aboutthe triangle
- Trigonometrygoesfar beyond triangles, though. All the anglesofa triangle measure between 0◦ and180◦,but trigonometryalsodeals with larger angles, such as300◦ or 500◦,and even with negativeangles, such as −100◦.These deeper aspectsoftrigonometry haveapplicationsinelectrical engineering and acoustics,amongother scientiﬁc disciplines
- ,sine, cosine andtangent are described as trigonometric functions:they are functionsbecause each of them is a rulethattakes an input number (the size of an angle)and
- produces an outputnumber.
### 1 Right-angled triangles
#### 1.1Radiansand degrees
- units formeasuringangles, which canbe usedasan alternative to degrees
- e more convenient to work with i
- ,considerany circle.Anunbroken piece of itscircumferenceiscalled an arc
- .The angle at the centreissaid to be subtended by the arc.
- Suppose thatthe circle hasradius r,and you drawanarc alsooflength r on itscircumference
- the angle subtended by the arc is 1 radian
- Ifthe arc were of length 2r thenthe angle wouldbe 2 radians,
- , 360◦ is the same angle as 2π radians(a
- you shouldusually write fractionsof π in ‘vertical’ fraction notation
- 1radian = 180◦ π ,
- Length of an arcofa circle arc length = rθ,
- A sector of a circle is the ‘slice’ of the circle lyingbetween tworadii,
- Consider a circle of
  radius r.Its fullareais πr2.Half of the circle is asector of angle π radians
  (a half turn), which hasarea 1
  2πr2.Thatis,
- an angle of θ radiansgives asector of area 1 2r2θ.
- areaofsector = 1
  2r2θ,
- Althoughradiansusually givesimplermathematical formulas thandegrees, thereare manycircumstances where degrees are the more appropriate choiceofunit
- Degrees tend to be usedinpracticalsituations– forexample, by carpenters who want to measure the anglesatthe cornersofpieces of wood.
- ,you must include the symbol ◦ afterthe size of an angle measured in degrees.
- ,itisusualto omit the word ‘radians’,and write these anglessimply as π/2and 2π/3.
- , if the size of an angle is stated without the symbol ◦, then the angle is measured in radians.
##### Some usefulconventions
- ,ifyou are asked to solve anabstracttrigonometric problem, where no units of length are given,then (unlessthe question speciﬁesotherwise) you shouldexpress your answersasexact values,ratherthandecimal approximations, wheneveritispossibletodothisreasonablyconcisely
- you mightexpress an answer as a fraction or a surd, or in terms of π
- Ifyou are asked to solvea practicaltrigonometric problem, then you shouldnormally giveyouranswersasdecimal approximations.
#### 1.2Sine, cosine and tangent
- therelationships between anglesand side lengths in right-angledtriangle
- Remember thatthe side opposite the rightangle in a right-angled triangle is calledthe hypotenuse,and it is alwaysthe longest side.
  Pythagoras’ theorem Foraright-angledtriangle,the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sumofthe squaresofthe othertwo sides.
- Forexample,you might have atriangle like the one inFigure 9(a),and youwantto knowthe length of the side a.Oryou mighthavea triangle like the one in Figure 9(b), andyou want to know the size of the angle θ.
- Problems like these canbe solved by using the sine, cosine and tangent of an angle.
- rany right-angledtriangle with θ as oneofits acute angles,
- hyp for the hypotenuse,opp for the side opposite the angle θ,and adjfor the side
- Youalwaysget the same answersfor the sine, cosine andtangent of a particular angle θ,no matterwhich right-angledtriangle with θ as oneof itsacute anglesyou consider
- all the right-angledtriangleswith θ as oneoftheir angles are scaled-up or scaled-down (and possiblyﬂippedover) versionsofeach other–inother words, they are all similar
- The sine,cosineand tangentofanangle are known as trigonometric ratios,
#### 1.3Finding unknown sidelengths in right-angled triangles
- If youknowone of the acute anglesand one ofthe side lengths in a right-angledtriangle,thenyou canuse trigonometric ratios to ﬁndeither of the othertwo side lengths.
- Ifyou walk only a short distance, then you’re likelyto obtain an inaccurate estimate, because thenthe angle θ will be closeto90
#### 1.4Finding unknown angles in right-angled triangles
- If youknowthe tangentofanacute angle (orthe sine or cosine of the angle), then you can use your calculator to ﬁndthe angle.
- Note thatyou maychoose to write eithertan−1 x or tan−1(x)
- The anglessin−1 x,cos−1 x andtan−1 x are calledthe inverse sine, inverse cosine and inverse tangent
- The inversesine, inversecosine and inversetangent of a number x are also calledthe arcsine, arccosine and arctangent of x
- rthatthe strategiesthatyou’vemet so farfor ﬁnding unknown side lengths andanglesare valid only in right-angled triangles
#### 1.5Trigonometric ratiosofspecial angles
- the angle π/3(60◦). Thisangle is oneofthe anglesofan equilateraltriangle,
- an equilateral triangle thatissplit into tworight-angled trianglesby a vertical line
- hassides of length 2, andthe vertical linedivides the base of the triangle into two equal parts, each of length 1
- By Pythagoras’theorem, the length of the vertical line is !
  22 − 12 = 3, √ as marked in the diagram. Youcan nowapplythe formulas sin π 3 = opp hyp , cos π 3 = adj hyp andtan π 3 = opp adj
- sin π 3 √ 3 = 2 ,
- Youcan ﬁnd the trigonometric ratios forthe angle π/6 (30◦)by using the same diagram, Figure 17. Thisisbecause the otheracute angle in the left-hand triangle in Figure 17 is π/6
- Let’snow considerthe angle π/4(45◦). To ﬁnd the trigonometric ratios for thisangle,you canuse the right-angledtriangle
- created by splitting asquare down one ofits diagonals
- The trigonometric ratios forthe angles π/6, π/4 and π/3are listedin Table 2, which will be referred to asthe specialanglestable.
- values of sine andcosine inTable 2 are all less than1.
- However,asyou cansee from Table 2, the tangentof an acute angle can be lessthan1,equal to 1, or greater than1.
#### 1.6Trigonometric identities
- anidentityisan equation thatissatisﬁed byall possiblevalues of itsvariables
- A trigonometricidentity is an identity thatinvolves one ormore trigonometric ratios.
- The notation sin2 θ for (sin θ)2 is convenient as it avoidssome brackets.
- .However, remember thatsin−1 x does not mean (sinx)−1
- Youcan use the two trigonometric identities above to deducethe values of all the trigonometric ratios fora particular acute angle if youknowthe value ofone of these ratios
- t two trigonometric identities involvebothth
- sin 1π 2 cos 1π 2 − θ =cos θ " − θ =sin θ "
### 2 Trigonometric functions
#### 2.1Angles of anysize
- In thissection you’ll learn aboutthe sine,cosine and tangentofevery angle,evennegative angles.
- learn to associatewitheach angle θ a particular point P on the unit circle,which is the circle with radius1 centred on the origin.
- A quadrant is one ofthe four regionsseparated oﬀ by the x-axis and y-axis
#### 2.2Sine, cosine and tangent of anyangle
- howthe sine,cosine and tangentofany angle are deﬁned.
- These equationsare used to deﬁne the sine,cosine and tangentof any angle θ,asfollows.
  Sine, cosineand tangent Supposethat θ is anyangle and(x, y)are the coordinates of its associated point P on the unit circle.Then sin θ = y, cos θ = x, and, provided that x &=0, tan θ = y x . (If x =0,thentan θ is undeﬁned.)
- ifthe point P associated with an angle θ lies on the y-axis,then the tangentof θ is undeﬁned
- π 2 + nπ, where n is an integer, hasno tangent.
- Thisdiagram, which we’ll call the ASTC diagram,isoften useful,soit’sa good idea to memoriseit, if you can.
#### 2.3Graphs of sine, cosine and tangent
- Youhaveseen thatsine, cosine andtangent are ruleswhose inputs are the sizes of anglesand whose outputs are numbers. In otherwords, sine,cosine andtangent are functions.They are known as trigonometricfunctions.
##### The graph of the sinefunction
- from 0to 2π, the value ofsin θ oscillates from 0to 1 to 0 to −1 and back to 0.
- This impliesthatthe graphofsine oscillates endlessly to the rightand to the left, repeatingits shapeafterevery interval of 2π
- Thisfactisexpressedby saying thatthe graphis periodic,with period 2π.
##### The graph of the cosine function
- the graphofsine, the graphofcosine isperiodicwith period2π,and any verticalline through the centreofa peak or trough is a line of mirror symmetry.
- you canobtain the graphofcosineby translatingthe graphofsine to the left by π/2.
##### The graph of the tangentfunction
- diﬀers from the othertwo graphs in thatitisbroken up
- the graphoftangent is periodic,
- The breaks in the graphoccurwhen θ = π/2+ nπ,for some integer n.
- because the y-coordinateofthe point P is zero,
- Using the graphs to ﬁndvaluesoftrigonometricfunctions
##### Using the variables x and y fortrigonometricfunctions
- If youadd together manyscaledsine and cosine functions, then you obtain atypeoffunction calleda Fourier series.
- s.Such functionscan be used to model any periodicwave.
#### 2.4Inverse trigonometric functions
- The sine,cosineand tangentfunctionsare notone-to-one.
- to start by specifying a new function thathas the same rule as the originalfunction,but asmaller domain.
- Forthe sine function,the mostconvenientsmaller domain is the interval [−π/2,π/2],
- Its inversefunction is calledthe inverse sine function
- Inversesinefunction The inverse sine function sin−1 is the function with domain [−1, 1] andrule sin−1 x = y, where y is the number in the interval [−π/2,π/2] suchthatsin y = x.
- its inverse function are the reﬂectionsofeach other in the line y = x
- ,the cosine function is notone-to-one,sotoobtain an inversefunction we must restrictits domain.
- s the interval [0,π],
- calledthe inverse cosinefunction anddenoted by cos−1.
- Inversecosine The inverse cosinefunction cos−1 is the function with domain [−1, 1] andrule cos−1 x = y, where y is the number in the interval [0,π]such thatcos y = x.
- We cancarry outa similar processfor the tangentfunction
- The most convenient smaller domain forthisfunction is the interval (−π/2,π/2
- Inversetangent The inverse tangent function tan−1 is the function with domain R andrule tan−1 x = y, where y is the number in the interval (−π/2,π/2) suchthattan y = x.
- The graphinFigure 40(a)has two verticalasymptotes, with equations x = −π/2 and x = π/2. Accordingly,the graphofthe inversetangent function,inFigure 40(b), hastwo horizontalasymptotes, with equations y = −π/2and y = π/2.
- The inversesine, inversecosine and inversetangent functionsare known as inverse trigonometricfunctions.
- a calculator maygivea decimal approximation where it is possibleto ﬁnd an exact value. As you saw earlier, you can ﬁnd the exact values of the inversesine, inversecosine orinverse tangentofsome special numbersbyusing values of sine,cosineand tangentthatyou know already.
- sin−1(−x)= − sin−1 x cos−1(−x)= π − cos−1 x tan−1(−x)= −tan−1 x
#### 2.5Solving simple trigonometric equations
- Equationsthatcontain trigonometric functionsofthe unknown(s) are called trigonometricequations
- Onesolution of such a simple trigonometric equation canbe obtained by using an inversetrigonometric function
- Usually when you want to solve a simple trigonometric equation,it’sbest to begin by ﬁnding all the solutionsthatlie in an interval of length 2π (360◦), such as [0, 2π]or[−π, π]
- There are usually two such solutions.
- Then you canobtain anyother solutionsthatyou want by adding integer multiplesof2π
- Suppose that θ is anyangle whose associated point P does notlie on either the x-or y-axis,and φ is the acute angle between OP andthe x-axis. Then sin θ = ± sinφ cos θ = ±cos φ tan θ = ±tan φ.
  The ASTC diagram tells you which sign appliesineach case.
  (The values sinφ,cos φ and tanφ are all positive,because φ is acute.)
- ,you can’tuse the ASTC methodif the solutionsofthe equation are multiplesof π/2.
- ,you can’tuse the ASTC methodif the solutionsofthe equation are multiplesof π/2.
- you can’tuse it to solveany of the following seven‘special’ trigonometric equations: sin θ =1, cos θ =1, sin θ = −1, cos θ = −1, sin θ =0, cos θ =0, tan θ =0.
### 3 Sineand cosine rules
- how to use trigonometryto ﬁnd side lengths and anglesintrianglesthatdon’t have a rightangle.
#### 3.1The sine rule
- the triangle here does nothavea rightangle,so the methods from Section 1 do not apply
- Here the vertices of atriangle are labelledas A, B and C, and the sidesare labelledas a, b and c.The labelsare chosen in such a way thatvertex A is opposite side a
- a dashedline oflength h hasbeen drawnfrom the vertex C,perpendicular to the opposite side c
- two lines are perpendicular if they are at rightanglesto each other
- sinA = , so h = b sin A. h b
- sinB = h a , so h = a sin B
- a
  =
  sinA
  sinB
  b
  =
  sinC
- the sine rule holdsfor any triangle,evenifithas an obtuse angle
- Usingthe sineruletoﬁnd a sidelength Youcan use the sine rule to ﬁndanunknown side length of a triangle if youknow • the opposite angle • anotherside lengthand itsoppositeangle.
- wyou canuse the sine rule to ﬁndunknown angles.
- Because A is an angle of a triangle,itliesbetween 0◦ and180◦.However the equation sinA =0.905 ... has two solutionsbetween 0◦ and180◦,
- if youuse the sine rule to ﬁndan unknown angle,thenyou mayonly be able to narrowdownthe answer to two possibilities
- , in a triangle, larger angles are found opposite longer sides, andviceversa.
- Using the sineruletoﬁnd an angle Youcan use the sine rule to ﬁndanunknown angle in a triangle if you know: • the opposite side length • anotherside lengthand itsoppositeangle.
  Sometimesyou alsoneed to know whether the unknownangle is acute or obtuse.
#### 3.2The cosine rule
- Cosinerule a2 = b2 + c2 − 2bc cosA
- likethe sine rule,the cosine rule holdsfor anytriangle,evenifithas an obtuseangle.
- if C is a rightangle (π/2or90◦), then cosC =0,and the last equation abovebecomes a2 + b2 = c2,which is Pythagoras’theoremfor a right-angledtriangle.Inthisway youcan seethatthe cosine rule is amore general version of Pythagoras’theorem.
- Using the cosine ruletoﬁnd a sidelength Youcan use the cosine rule to ﬁndanunknown side length of a triangle if youknowthe othertwo side lengths andthe angle between them.
- y if you knowthe othertwo side lengths andthe angle opposite one ofthem.
- it’s simplerto start by using the sine rule.
- Using the cosine ruletoﬁnd an angle Youcan use the cosine rule to ﬁndanunknown angle if youknowall three side lengths.
#### 3.3The area of a triangle
- area ofa triangle,interms of the lengths of twosides andthe angle between these sides
- Area of a triangle Foratriangle with an angle θ between twosides of lengths a and b, area = 1 2ab sin θ.
- .Ifthe angle θ is obtuse, then the area formulastill works, but its justiﬁcation is slightlydiﬀeren
- In mathematics, the word triangulate meansto divide upinto triangles. Any polygon canbe triangulated
#### 3.4The angleofinclinationofa line
- The angleofinclination of astraightlineisthe angle thatitmakes with the x-axis,measured anticlockwisefrom the positive direction of the x-axis
- Gradientand angleofinclination ofastraight line Forany non-vertical straightline withangle of inclination θ, gradient= tan θ.
  Remember thatthe angle of inclination is measured when the line is drawnonaxes withequal scales.
- thereisnot aformulafor area in terms of only A, B and C.Thisisbecause similar triangles, whichcan vary in area, have thesame angles.
- there is aformulafor area in terms of a, b and c.You shouldexpect this,because anytwo diﬀerenttriangleswithsidelengths a, b and c are congruent
- other. Twocongruenttriangles(oneﬂipped over)are shown below.

### 4 Further trigonometric identities
- There’s no need to memoriseall the trigonometric identities thatyou’ll meet in thissection:it’smore importantthatyou become familiar with using them
#### 4.1Two simple trigonometric identities
#### 4.2Trigonometric identities from thegraphs of sine,cosine and tangent
- The vertical axis is a lineofmirror symmetry for the graphofcosine, which meansthatcos θ andcos(−θ)are equal,
#### 4.3Cosecant, secant and cotangent
- There are three further ratios of the sides of such a triangle.These ratios are known asthe cosecant, secant and cotangent
- cosec θ = hyp opp , sec θ = hyp adj andcot θ = adj opp .
- Cosecant, secantand cotangent cosec θ = 1 sin θ sec θ = cot θ = 1 cos θ cos θ sin θ (provided sin θ &=0) (provided cos θ &=0) (provided sin θ &=0)
- cot θ = 1 tan θ (provided sin θ &=0 andcos θ &=0)
- So,essentially,the cosecant,secant andcotangent functionsare the reciprocals of the sine, cosine andtangent functions
#### 4.4Anglesum and anglediﬀerence identities
- These allow youto obtain the exact values of the sine, cosine andtangent of manymore angles
- begin with an identity thatexpressessin(A+B)interms of sinA, sinB,cosA andcosB.
- known as the anglesum identity for sine.
- in the case where A and B are acute angles
- you have a right-angledtriangle with an acute angle A,anadjacentsideoflength1,and hypotenuse of length p
- also haveanotherright-angledtriangle with an acute angle B,anadjacentsideoflength 1,and hypotenuse of length q,
- stick these twotrianglestogether alongtheir sidesoflength1
- applythe formulafor the areaofa triangle
- s. The
  area ofthe right-angledtriangle on the left is 1
  2p sinA,the areaofthe
  right-angledtriangle on the rightis
  triangle is 1
  1
  2q sinB,and the areaofthe large
  2pq sin(A+B). Butthe area ofthe largetriangle is alsoequal
  to the sumofthe areas of the two right-angledtriangles. Thatis,
  1
  2pq sin(A+B)= 1
  2p sinA+ 1
  2q sin B.
- sin(A+B)= 1 q sinA+ sin B.
  1 p
- The right-angledtriangle on the left of Figure 64 gives cosA = adj hyp = , 1 p andthe right-angledtriangle on the rightofFigure 64 gives cosB = adj hyp = . 1 q Together the lastthree equationsgive sin(A+B)=sinAcosB +cosA sin B.
- Althoughthe justiﬁcation above appliesonlywhen the angles A and B are acute,the identity holdsfor all angles A and B
- Anglesum identities forsineand cosine sin(A+B)=sinAcosB +cosA sinB cos(A+B)=cosAcosB − sinA sinB
- Anglesum identity fortangent tan(A+B)= tanA +tanB 1 − tanAtanB
- Anglediﬀerence identities sin(A−B)=sinAcosB − cosA sinB cos(A−B)=cosAcosB +sinA sinB tan(A−B)= tanA− tanB 1+ tanAtanB

#### 4.5Double-angleand half-angleidentities
- Double-angleidentities sin(2θ)=2 sin θ cos θ cos(2θ)=cos2 θ − sin2 θ tan(2θ)= 2tan θ 1 − tan2 θ
- To obtain these, recall thatsin2 θ +cos2 θ =1,
- Alternative double-angleidentities forcosine cos(2θ)= 1 − 2sin2 θ cos(2θ)= 2cos2 θ − 1
- These alternative double-angle identities forcosine can be rearrangedinto the forms below. In these forms they are knownasthe half-angle identities.
  Half-angleidentities sin2 θ = 1 ; 2(1 − cos(2θ)) cos2 θ = 1 2(1 +cos(2θ))
- The description ‘half-angle’refersto the fact thatthese identities are sometimesstated with θ and2θ replaced by 1 2θ and θ,respectively, as follows: sin2 &1 2θ - cos2 &1 2θ - = 1 2(1 − cos θ) = 1 2(1 +cos θ).
- once you’ve foundthe exact value ofthe sine, cosine or tangentofa particular acute angle,you canﬁnd the exact values of the othertwo trigonometric ratios forthe angle by sketchinga suitable right-angledtriangle,and using Pythagoras’theoremand the deﬁnitionsof sine,cosine and tangent
#### 4.6Yet more trigonometric identities
- Forexample,considerthe angle sum andangle diﬀerenceidentitiesfor sine: sin(A+B)=sinAcosB +cosA sinB sin(A−B)=sinAcosB − cosA sin B. Adding these gives sin(A+B)+ sin(A−B)=2 sinAcos B.
- Thisidentity enables you to convert a productofa sine anda cosine on the right-hand side into the sum oftwo sinesonthe left-hand side
- The newidentity above canbe rearrangedtogivea slightlydiﬀerent identity thathas some useful applications. Suppose thatyou let C = A+B and D = A− B.
  Solvingthese equationsfor A and B,byﬁrstadding themand then subtracting them,gives A = C +D 2 and B = C −D 2 .
  Substituting into the identity above gives sinC +sinD =2sin .
  C +D 2 0 cos .
  C −D 2 0
- sinA +sinB =2sin sinA− sinB =2sin .
  . A+B 2 A−B 2 cosA +cosB =2cos .
  0 0 cos cos A+B 2 cosA− cosB = −2sin .
  0 .
  . A−B 2 A+B 2 cos A+B 2 0 .
  0 0 A−B 2 sin .
  0 A−B 2 0
