- Summary: The CIA triad in cybersecurity stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, which are essential for system security. Techniques like encryption and redundancy help protect data and ensure users can access it without interruption. Understanding and applying these concepts is crucial for mitigating security threats.

## Highlights
- m ‘CIA triad’
- Confidentiality:
- who or what is to be granted access to the data or the system;
- Integrity:
- unchanged from its intended form.
- Availability
- data should be readily available to authorised users
- the requirement to keep our data hidden from unauthorised access
- we can do by encrypting the data
- This type of communication interception is sometimes referred to as a man-in-the-middle attack, or eavesdropping attack
- can also be considered as a passive attack
- Imagine a scenario where a threat actor can gain access to and alter a patient’s medical records:
- Organisations are bound by law to handle carefully personal information they hold on individuals or other organisations.
- Maintaining OS integrity can be as simple as automatically updating security patches or timely service pack installations
- Access control systems
- The threat actor now has several malicious options available; these are sometimes referred to as attack vectors.
- Imagine that the threat actor now has access to the system, and particularly the unsecured router in the previous scenario. From there, it would be possible for the threat actor to add their own username and password and assign administrator privilege
- it would also be possible to easily move from a passive attack to an active attack
- , this would bring about an operational disruption to the system, which can be referred to as a denial-of-service (DoS) attack
- The term mitigation is used to describe how we intend to reduce the risk of events occurring that could harmfully impact our systems o
- removing the risk entirely is impossible,
