### 1 Numbers
- revise diﬀerent typesofnumbers,and some basic skills associated with workingwithnumbers.
#### 1.1 Types of numbers
- The naturalnumbers,alsoknown as the positiveintegers,are the counting numbers, 1, 2, 3,. .. .
- (The symbol‘... ’hereiscalled an ellipsis
- The natural numbers, together with theirnegatives andzero, form the integers:
- e rational numbers are the numbersthatcan be writteninthe form integer integer ;
- The real numbers include all the rational numbers, andmanyother numbersaswell. Auseful waytothink of the real numbersistoenvisage them as lyingalonga straightlinethatextends inﬁnitely farineach direction,called the number line or the real line.
- Four of the numbersmarked in Figure 1are irrational, namely − and π.
- e hasvalueapproximately2.72,
- To checkthatthe numbers − 2, √ √ 2, e and π are irrational, youhaveto provethattheycan’t be writtenasaninteger dividedbyaninteger.
- Every rational number canbewrittenasa decimal number.Todothis, youdividethe topnumberofthe fraction of the form integer integer
- The decimal forms of both 2 3 and 83 74 are recurring:eachofthemhas ablock of oneormore digitsafterthe decimal pointthatrepeats indeﬁnitely.
- 3 =0.666 666 666 ... =0. ˙6= 0.6, and 83 74 =1.1216 216 216 216 ... =1.1˙21˙6= 1.1216 .
- Decimal formsofrationaland irrational numbers The rational numbersare the decimal numbersthatterminateor recur.
  The irrational numbersare the decimal numberswithaninﬁnite number of digitsafterthe decimal pointbut with no blockofdigits thatrepeats indeﬁnitely.
#### 1.2 Working withnumbers
##### TheBIDMASrules
- Carry outmathematical operationsinthe following order. B brackets I indices (powersand roots) D divisions M multiplications A additions S subtractions   same precedence same precedence

- Takinga root of anumbermeans taking its square root
- where division is indicatedusing fraction notation,the horizontalline notonlyindicatesdivision but alsoactsasbrackets
##### Rounding
- e variouswaystoround anumber
- to aparticular number of decimalplaces (
- Youcan alsoround to the nearest whole number,ortothe nearest 10
- .More often, it’s appropriatetoround to aparticular number of signiﬁcantﬁgures
- Youround up if this digit is 5ormore,and round down otherwise.
- youshouldstate howit’sbeen rounded, in brackets afterthe rounded number
- 0.0238 =0.024 (to 3d.p.)
- 50 629 =50600 (to 3s.f.)
- 0.002 9582= 0.0030 (to 2s.f.)

- When youneed to round anegativenumber, youshouldround the part afterthe minus sign in the same way
- When you’re rounding an answer obtained from your calculator, it’s often useful to writedowna more precise version of the answer before youround it.You candothisbyusing the ‘...’symbol, likethis: 9.869 604 40 ... =9.87 (to 2d.p.).
- Also, as an alternative to writinginbrackets howyou roundeda number, youcan replacethe equals sign by the symbol ≈,which means, andisread as,‘is approximatelyequal to’. Forexample,you canwrite 9.869 604 40 ... ≈ 9.87.
- auseful rule of thumbistoround to the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in the least precise number used
- ifanactivityorTMA question includesa number with no units, suchas‘120’, then youshouldusually assumethat thisnumberisexact,whereas if it includesa number with units, suchas ‘120cm’, then youshouldusually assumethatthisisa measurementand hasbeen rounded.
- knownas rounding errors
- wheneveryou carry outa calculation using an answer thatyou found earlier, youshoulduse the full-calculator-precision version
- ostore it in your calculator’s memory
##### Negative numbers
- Adding anegativenumberisthe same as subtracting the corresponding positive number.
  Subtracting anegativenumberisthe same as adding the corresponding positive number.
- When twonumbers are multipliedordivided: • if the signsare diﬀerent,thenthe answer is negative • if the signsare thesame,thenthe answer is positive.
- The operation of puttinga minus sign in frontofa number is called taking the negative of the number
- Youcan take the negativeofa number that’salreadynegative
- To seewhy thisis, notice thattakingthe negativeofa positive number is the same as subtracting it from zero: forexample, −3= 0 − 3. It’s justthe same fornegativenumbers: −(−7) =0− (−7) =0+7 =7.
- f taking anegativehas the same precedence in the BIDMAS rulesassubtraction
- toevaluatethe expression x2 − 2x when x = −3, youproceed as follows: x2 − 2x =(−3)2 − 2 × (−3) =9− (−6) =9+6 =15.
##### Units of measurement
- from the standard metric system
- There are sevenSI base units,from which all the otherunits are derived.
- metre(m),the kilogram (kg) andthe second (s).
- nano micro milli centi kilo mega n µ m c k M a billionth amillionth  1 109  1  106  a thousandth  1 1000 a hundredth  1 100   Example 1nanometre(nm)= 1 109 metre 1micrometre(µm) = 1 106 metre 1millimetre(mm) = 1 1000 metre 1centimetre(cm)= 1 100 metre a thousand(1000) 1kilometre(km)=1000 metres a million (106) 1 megametre(Mm) =106 metres
##### Four mathematical words
- A quotient of twonumbers is the resultofdividingone by the other.
#### 1.3 Integers
- If an integer a dividesexactly into anotherinteger b,thenwesay that • b is a multiple of a,or • b is divisible by a,or • a is a factor or divisor of b.
- every integerisbotha multiple anda factor of itself:
- A factorpair of an integerisa pair of itsfactors thatmultiplytogether to givethe integer
- Forexample,the factor pairs of 12 are 1, 12; 2, 6; 3, 4; −1, −12; −2, −6; −3, −4;
- an integerthatcan be writteninthe form a2 forsome integer a –iscalled a square number or a perfect square
- An integergreater than1 whose only factors are 1and itself is calleda prime number,orjust a prime.
- An integergreater than1 thatisn’ta prime number is calleda composite number.
- Everyinteger greater than1 canbewrittenasa productofprime factors in justone way
- The prime factorisation
- To ﬁndthe prime factorisationofanintegergreater than1
- Repeatedly ‘factorout’ the prime 2until youobtain anumber thatisn’tdivisible by 2.
  • Repeatedly factor outthe prime 3until youobtain anumberthat isn’tdivisible by 3.
  • Repeatedly factor outthe prime 5until youobtain anumberthat isn’tdivisible by 5.
  Continue thisprocesswitheachofthe successive primes, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...,inturn. Stopwhenyou have aproductofprimes.
- A commonmultiple of twoormore integers is anumberthatisa multiple of all of them
- The lowest (or least) common multiple (LCM)oftwo or more integers is the smallest positive integerthatisa multiple of all of them
- ,a commonfactor of twoormore integers is anumberthatisa factor of all of them.
- The highest common factor (HCF)(or greatest commondivisor (GCD))oftwo or more integers is the largest positive number thatisa factor of all of them
- Noticethatthe lowest common multiple andhighestcommon factor of two or more integers are the same as the lowest common multiple andhighest common factor of the corresponding positive integers
- lowest common multiple of −4and 6isthe same as the lowest common multiple of 4and 6, which is 12.
- u
- For largerintegers, or more tricky cases, youcan use their prime factorisations
- Usingprime factorisations to ﬁndLCMs and HCFs Find the lowest common multiple andhighestcommon factor of 594 and693.
  Solution Find andwriteout the prime factorisations, liningupeachprime with the same prime in the otherfactorisation(s), where possible.
  594 =2× 33 × 11 693 = 32 × 7 × 11 To ﬁnd the lowest common multiple,identifythe highest powerof the prime in each column,and multiply all these numberstogether.
  The LCMof594 and693 is 2 × 33 × 7 × 11 =4158.
  To ﬁnd the highestcommon factor, identify the lowest powerof the prime in each column,and multiply all these numberstogether.
  (Omit anyprimes, suchas2 and7 here,thatare missing from oneor more rows.) The HCFof594 and693 is 32 × 11 =99.
### 2 Algebraic expressions
#### 2.1 Algebraic terminology
- an expression is an arrangement of letters,numbers and/or mathematical symbols (such as +, −, ×, ÷,brackets, andsoon), which is suchthatifnumbers are substitutedfor anyletters present, then youcan work outthe valueofthe arrangement
- ,
- An expression thatcontainsletters (usually as well as numbersand mathematical symbols)isan algebraicexpression
- Anexpression,such as 10 − 2 × 4, thatcontainsonlynumbers andmathematical symbols is a numericalexpression
- Anexpression that’spart of alargerexpression, andcan be enclosed in brackets without aﬀectingthe meaningofthe larger expression,iscalled a subexpression
- Alettermay be a variable
- Alternatively, it maybean unknown
- .Oritmay represent a constant,
- Youuse equals signswhenyou’re workingwithexpressions, but expressionsdon’t contain equals signs. Forexample,the statement x +2x =3x isn’tanexpression –it’sanequation.An equation is madeupof two expressions, with an equals sign between them.
## New highlights added September 28, 2024 at 7:26 PM
- Atermlike −4, thatdoesn’tcontain anyvariables, is knownasa constant term
- ifa term hasthe form aﬁxed value × acombination of variables, then the ﬁxedvalueiscalled the coeﬃcient
- It’s alsopossiblefor acoeﬃcient to include constants.
  Forexample,inthe expression 8r3 − 4
  3πr3
- Moreprecisely,wesay thattwo expressionsare equivalent,ordiﬀerent forms of the same expression,iftheyhavethe same valueaseachother whatevervalues are chosen fortheir variables
- We alsosay thateitherexpression canbe rearranged, manipulated or rewritten to givethe other. Simplifying an expression meansrewritingitasa simplerexpression.
#### 2.2 Simplifying algebraic expressions
- .One wayinwhich some expressionscan be simpliﬁed is by collectingliketerms
- letters are usually ordered alphabetically
- (2x)3 =(2x) × (2x) × (2x)= 8x3
#### 2.3 Multiplying out brackets
- . Thisprocessiscalled multiplyingout thebrackets, expanding thebrackets,orsimply removing thebrackets.
- The newform of the expression,withno brackets, is calledthe expansion
- the subexpression thatmultipliesthe brackets is calledthe multiplier
- Multiply each term inside the brackets by the multiplier.
- Forany expressions A and B, the negativeof A−B is B −A.
- −(x − y)= y − x and −(n − 3n2)= 3n2 − n,
- Multiplyinganexpression thatcontainsseveral terms by asecond expression is the same as multiplying each term of the ﬁrst expression by the secondexpression.
##### Brackets in expressions with more thanone term
##### Multiplying outtwo pairs of brackets
- tthe eﬀect of multiplying outtwo pairs of brackets is that each terminthe ﬁrst pair of brackets is multipliedby each terminthe second pair of brackets,
- dyou canuse the acronym FOIL (ﬁrst terms,outerterms,innerterms,lastterms)tohelpyou remember them.
  Here’s an example.
#### Diﬀerencesoftwo squares
- Forany expressions A and B, (A+B)(A−B)= A2 −B2.
##### Squaredbrackets
- Squaring brackets Forany expressions A and B, (A+B)2 = A2 +2AB +B2, and (A−B)2 = A2 − 2AB +B2.
##### Simplest forms of expressions
- youshouldusually writeexpressionsinthe simplest wayyou can.
- shorter andeasiertounderstand
- s easier to evaluatefor anyparticular valueof x.
- often there’sno‘rightanswer’for the simplest form.
- Oneform mightbebetter forsome purposes
- In particular, multiplyingout the brackets in an expression doesn’talways simplifyit.
### 3 Algebraic factors, multiples and fractions
#### 3.1 Factors andmultiples of algebraic expressions
- something × something, then both ‘somethings’ are factors of the expression,and the expression is a multiple of both ‘somethings’
- a2b = a × ab shows thatboth a and ab are factors of a2b,and it alsoshows that a2b is a multiple of both a and ab.
- a commonfactor of twoormore algebraic expressions is an expression that’sa factor of all of them.
- ,a commonmultiple of twoormore algebraic expressionsisan expression that’sa multiple of all of them.
- ,the expression abcd is acommon multiple of the twoexpressions ab and bc,
- In the context of algebraic expressions, highestcommonfactor meansa common factor thatisa multiple of all othercommon factors.
- lowest common multiple meansa common multiple thatisa factor of all othercommon multiples.
#### 3.2 Takingout commonfactors
- Factorising an expression meanswritingitasthe product of twoormore expressions
- s
- If all of the terms of an expression have acommon factor otherthan1, then the expression canbefactorised
- Find acommon factor
- Writethe common factor in front
- Writewhat’sleftofeachterminside the brackets.
- tyou cancheck whether afactorisation thatyou’vecarried outiscorrect by justmultiplying outthe brackets again.
- Sometimesit’sconvenienttotakeout acommon factor with aminus sign.
- , ‘what’sleft’ of each term will have the opposite sign
- If the coeﬃcients of the terms of an expression aren’tintegers, thenyou canoftenstill factorisethe expression
#### 3.3 Algebraic fractions
- An algebraic expression writteninthe form of afraction,suchasthe expression above, is calledan algebraicfraction.
- the topand bottomofthe algebraic fraction are calledthe numerator andthe denominator,
- When youwanttowriteanalgebraic fraction as part of alineoftext,you canreplacethe horizontallinebya slashsymbol,
- it’sconvenientwhenyou’re dealing with afraction whose numerator anddenominator are themselvesfractions, or whena fraction appears in apower,suchas2x/5.
- Youcan manipulatealgebraic fractionsusing the same rulesthatyou use fornumerical fractions
- an algebraic fraction is valid only forthe values of the variablesthatmakethe denominator non-zero.
##### Equivalenceofalgebraicfractions
- Twonumerical fractionsare equal or equivalent if onecan be obtained from the otherbymultiplying or dividing both the numerator andthe denominator
- a(b − 2) b(b − 2) and a b are equivalent.
  Noticethatthe ﬁrst of these twoalgebraic fractionsisvalidfor all values of itsvariablesexcept b =0 and b =2,whereas the secondisvalidfor all values of itsvariablesexceptjust b =0.Sothe twofractionsaren’t exactly the same.Thissort of thing doesn’tusually matter, but sometimesitdoes.
##### Simplifying algebraicfractions
- Anumerical fraction whose numerator anddenominator have acommon factor canbesimpliﬁed by dividing both the numerator andthe denominator by thisfactor
- In the same way, an algebraic fraction whose numerator anddenominator have acommon factor canbesimpliﬁed by dividing both the numerator andthe denominator by the factor
- knownas cancelling the factor, or cancellingdown the fraction.
- .Normally, however, youshouldbeabletoshowall stagesofthe cancellation on a single copy of the fraction.
- restrictions, b '=0 and x '=0,are usedtoindicate thatthe originaland the ﬁnalfraction in each part are equivalent only if the restriction holds
- Often we won’tnotesuchrestrictionsexplicitly, but youshouldkeep in mindthattheyapply.
- Ifyou do want to crossout factors in afraction, perhapsbecause it’s acomplicatedone,thenyou shouldmakesurethat your workingalsoincludesa copy of the unsimpliﬁed fraction with nothing crossedout.
- dividingitbya second expression is the same as dividing each term of the expression by the secondexpression.
##### Adding andsubtracting algebraicfractions
- Makesurethatthe fractionshavethe same denominator –if necessary,rewriteeachfraction as an equivalent fraction to achievethis.
- Addorsubtractthe numerators.
- Simplifythe answer if possible.
##### Expanding algebraicfractions
- ns
- tifyou have an algebraic fraction whose numerator is a sum of terms,thenyou canrewriteitsothateachtermisindividually dividedbythe denominator.
- Thisprocedureisknown as expanding t
- tanalgebraic fraction canbeexpandedonlyifithas asum of terms in the numerator
##### Multiplyingand dividing algebraicfractions
- To multiply numerical fractions, youmultiplythe numerators together and multiply the denominators together
- Anumberand its reciprocal multiply together to give1
- tthe reciprocal of anumberisthatitis1 dividedbythe number
- the reciprocal of afraction,you justswapthe numerator andthe denominator.
- to divide by a numerical fraction,you multiply by itsreciprocal.
- histechniqueisk
- Thistechniqueisknown as cross-cancelling
### 4 Roots andpowers
#### 4.1 Roots of numbers
- As youknow, a square root of anumberisa number thatwhensquared (raised to the power2)gives the originalnumber
- ,a cube root of anumberisa number thatwhencubed (raised to the power3)gives the originalnumber.
- a fourth root of anumberisa number thatwhenraised to the power4 gives the originalnumber, and ﬁfth roots, sixthroots andsoonare deﬁnedina similar way.
- Everypositivenumberhas twosquare roots, apositiveone anda negative one.
- For everyevennatural number n,every positive number hasexactly tworeal nth roots
- everynegativenumberhas no real nth roots
- For every odd natural number n,every real number hasexactly onereal nth root
- ,the twosquare rootsof 36 are ±6
- The symbol √ is usedtodenotethe positive square root of apositivereal number
- ‘if x2 =4,then x = ± Similarly,the symbol 3√ number,the symbol 4√ √ 4= ±2’.
- Mostroots of numbersare irrational numbers.
- Because numberslikethese can’tbewrittendownexactly as fractionsor terminatingdecimals,weoftenleave them justastheyare in calculations andinthe answerstocalculations.
- a surd is a numerical expression thatcontainsone or more irrational roots
#### 4.2 Manipulatingsurds
- e it is useful to be able to simplifystraightforward surds without having to resort to acalculator
- The squarerootofa productofnumbers is the same as the product of the square rootsofthe numbers, andsimilarly fora quotient: √ ab = a √ √ b,  a b √ a = √ .
- If,inanirrational square root (such as √ 48 or √ 2)( √ √ √ 3 − 2 (c) (1 − 5)(6 − 2 √ √ 2) √ 5) 10) in asurd, the number underthe square root sign has afactorthat’sa perfect square,thenyou cansimplifythissquare root.
- If asurdcontainsanirrational root in the denominator of afraction,thenit’ssometimesuseful to rewriteitso thatthe denominator no longercontainsthisirrational root.Thisiscalled rationalising the denominator
- You can rationalisea denominator likethisbymultiplying the topand bottomof the fraction by a conjugate of the expression in the denominator
- the expression thatyou getwhenyou change the sign of oneofthe two terms
- (A+B)(A−B),
- , if the ﬁnal answer thatyou’vefound to aquestion is asurd, thenyou shoulduse the methods in thissubsection to simplifyit
#### 4.3 Working withpowers
- Here the number 2iscalled the basenumber or just base,and the superscript3 is calledthe power, index or exponent.
- The word ‘power’ is alsousedtorefer to the result of raisinga number to apower –for example,wesay that23,or8,isa power of 2.
- e knownas indexlaws.
- Indexlawsfor asinglebase To multiply twopowerswiththe same base,add the indices: aman = am+n.
  To divide twopowerswiththe same base,subtractthe indices: am an = am−n.
  To ﬁnd apower of apower,multiplythe indices: (am)n = amn.
- considerthe power20.Ifthe ﬁrst indexlaw in the boxabove worksfor thispower,then, forinstance, 2320 =23+0 =23.
- .Sothe valueof20 must be 1.
- let’s consider2−3,for example.Again,ifthe ﬁrst indexlaw in the boxabove worksfor thispower,then, forexample, 232−3 =23+(−3) =20 =1.
- So 2−3 must be the reciprocal of 23;thatis, 2−3 =1/23.
- a0 =1.
- 1 a−n = an
- Indices canalsobefractions, or anyrealnumbers at all
- (ab)3 = ab × ab × ab = ababab = aaabbb = a3b3, a b 3 = a b × a b × a b = aaa bbb = a3 b3 .
- Indexlawsfor twobases Apower of aproductofnumbers is the same as the productofthe same powers of the numbers, andsimilarly fora powerofa quotient: (ab)n = anbn, a b n = an bn .
- It’softenbest foryourﬁnalversion to include only positive indices,
- (2h−3g)2 =22(h−3)2g2 =4h−6g2 =
- tioned aboveand illustrated in Example 20, whenyou’re simplifying an expre
- sometimesa ﬁnalform thatcontainsnegativeindices is simpler, or more useful.
- considerthe power21/3
- (21/3)3 =2(1/3)×3 =21 =2.
- ifyou raise21/3 to the power3,thenyou get2.So21/3 must be the cube root of 2; thatis, 21/3 = 3√ 2.
- 25/3 =2(1/3)×5 = 21/35  =  3√ 5 2
- So 25/3 must be the cube root of 2, raised to the power5
- 25/3 =25×(1/3) = 251/3  = √3 25.
- Converting between fractionalindices androots a1/n = n√ a am/n =  n√ m a = n√ am
## New highlights added October 2, 2024 at 9:29 AM
- the notation √na is deﬁnedonlywhen a is positive or zero, only positive numbersand zerocan be raised to fractional powers.So the notation an hasnomeaning if a is negativeand n is notaninteger.
- , it’s oftenbesttoavoid using anyrootsignsother thanthe square root sign √ in algebraic expressions
- Youshouldsimplifyanalgebraic expression thatcontainsfractional indices in the same ways as an expression thatcontainsonlyinteger indices
- Youshouldusually leaveany otherfractional indices as they are
- the basicideaisthatyou canwork outthe valueofany positive number raised to anyirrational index
- . All the indexlawsthatyou’vemet in thissubsection hold forindices andbasenumbers thatare anyreal numbers
- (am)n = amn
- Indexlaws aman = am+n a0 =1 (ab)n = anbn a1/n = n√ a am an = am−n a−n = 1 an an b = an bn am/n =( n√ a )m = n√ am
##### Scientiﬁcnotation
- (alsoknown as standard form
- helpful when you’re dealing with very large or very small numbers
- (a number between 1and 10, but notincluding 10) ×(aninteger poweroften).
- 427 =4.27 × 100 = 4.27 × 102
- 0.427 =4.27 × 0.1 = 4.27 × 10−1
### 5 Equations
#### 5.1 Terminology forequations
- . Youcan placeanequals sign between any twoexpressions, to form an equation.Here’sanexample:
- Usually youform an equation like thiswhenyou’re interestedinthe values of the variables
- These values are said to satisfy the equation,and are called solutions
- ,an equation thatcontainsthe variables x and y andnoother variablesisan equation in x and y,and so on.
- Youshouldevaluatethe left- andright-hand sides separately,and checkwhethereachsidegives the same answer.
- It’s traditional to useletters from near the endofthe alphabet, such as x, y and z,torepresent unknowns
- letters from near the start of the alphabet, such as a, b and c,torepresent knownconstants
- An equation thatissatisﬁedby all possiblevalues of itsvariablesiscalled an identity
- (Insome texts, an identity is indicatedusing the symbol ≡,ratherthan=.)
- Sometimesthe variablesinanequation are restrictedtonumbers of a particular type.For example,ifanequation containsa variable that represents the length of an object,thenthisvariable wouldtakeonly positive values.
- It’s oftenclear from the context of an equation what type of values its variablescan take.
- fﬁnding the solutionsofanequation is called solving
#### 5.2 Rearranging equations
- o transform an equation into adiﬀerent equation that containsthe same variables, andissatisﬁedbythe same values of these variables.
- the original equation andthe newone are said to be equivalent,ordiﬀerent forms
- Rewritinganequation as asimplerequation is called simplifying
- • Rearrange the expressionsonone or both sides. • Swap the sides.
  • Do the same thing to both sides.
- Notethata non-negative number is onethat’seitherpositiveorzero.
- Doing anyofthe following thingsto both sides of an equation gives an equivalent equation.
  • Addsomething. • Subtractsomething.
  • Multiply by something (provided thatitisnon-zero).
  • Divide by something (provided thatitisnon-zero).
  • Raisetoapower (provided thatthe powerisnon-zero, andthat the expressionsoneachsideofthe equation cantakeonly non-negativevalues).
##### Change the side, change the sign
- Moving atermofone side of an equation to the otherside, and changingits sign,gives an equivalent equation.
- When youuse the rule,you must makesurethatthe term you’re moving is aterm of thewholeexpression on onesideofthe equation,not justa term of asubexpression
- Youmust alsomakesurethatthe term you’re moving becomesa term of the wholeexpression on the otherside, notjust atermofa subexpression.
##### Multiplying or dividing through
- • Multiplyingeachtermonbothsides of an equation by something (provided thatitisnon-zero) gives an equivalent equation.
  • Dividing each term on both sides of an equation by something (provided thatitisnon-zero) gives an equivalent equation.
- s known as multiplyingthrough
- g is knownas dividing through
- Onesituation where it’s oftenuseful to multiply through an equation is whenitcontainsfractions
- Thisisknown as clearing,orsimply removing,the fractions
- dkeep in mind thatmultiplying an equation through by an expression is guaranteed to giveanequivalent equation only if theexpression doesn’t take thevalue zero
##### Cross-multiplying
- Supposethatyou want to clearthe fractionsinthe equation x 2 = x +1 3 .
  Youcan do thisbymultiplying through by 2, andthenmultiplying through by 3. Thisgives the equation 3x =2(x +1).
  Youcan seethatthe overall eﬀect on the originalequation is thatyou have ‘multiplieddiagonally acrossthe equals sign
- Thistechniqueiscalled cross-multiplying.
- If A, B, C and D are anyexpressions, thenthe equations A B = C D and AD = BC are equivalent (provided that B and D are neverzero).
#### 5.3 Solving linearequations in one unknown
- A linear equation is oneinwhich,afteryou’veexpandedany brackets and clearedany fractions, each term is either aconstant term or aconstant valuetimesa variable
- a linearequation in oneunknown is alinearequation thatcontainsjust oneunknown.
- 1. Clearany fractionsand multiply outany brackets. To clear fractions, multiply through by asuitableexpression.
  2. Addorsubtractterms on both sides to getall the terms in the unknownonone side,and all the otherterms on the otherside. Collect liketerms.
  3. Divide both sides by the coeﬃcientofthe unknown.
- Noticethatbefore youcan multiply the equation in Example 23(b) through by 7a to clearthe fractions, youhavetomakethe assumption that a never takesthe value0
- It’sﬁne to makethisassumption,because it’s clearthat a =0 isn’ta solution
- you have to checkthe solution thatyou obtain:ifyou get a =0,thenthisdoesn’t countasa valid solution.
- , in mathematicsyou shouldalwaystry to use exact numbers, where it’s reasonably straightforward to do so.(However, it’s oftenhelpful to giveanswerstopracticalproblems as roundeddecimals.)
- The restrictionsdon’t normally cause problems whenyou’re solvinglinear equationsinone unknown, but theycan be an issue whenyou manipulate othertypes of equations.
- Forexample,supposethatyou want to solvethe equation x2 = x.
  Youmightthink thatyou couldsimplifythisequation by dividing both sides by x,togive x =1.
  However, something hasgonewronghere, because the ﬁrst equation has twosolutions, namely x =0 and x =1,whereas the secondequation has only onesolution, x =1
- As anotherexample,considerthe simple equation x =2.
  Youmightthink thatyou couldobtain an equivalent equation by raising both sides to the power2 (thatis, squaringbothsides). Thisgives x2 =4.
  Again,something hasgonewronghere, because whenthe variable x has the value −2, it doesn’tsatisfy the ﬁrst equation,
- Similar issuescan arisewhenyou’re solvinganequation involvingalgebraic fractions.
#### 5.4 Makinga variablethe subject of an equation
- If an equation containsmore thanone variable,and onesideofthe equation is justa single variable thatdoesn’tappearatall on the other side,thenthatvariable is calledthe subject of the equation.
- An equation with asubject is calleda formula.
- The purposeofa formulaisusually to allow youtoﬁnd the valueofthe subject
- If youhaveanequation relatingtwo or more variables, thenit’soften useful to rearrange it so thata particular variable becomesits subject.
- Thisstrategyworksprovidedthatthe equation is ‘linearinthe required subject’.
- t ‘making p4 the subject’, then raisingboth sidestothe power 1 4 .

### 6 Writingmathematics
- An important part of studying mathematicsatuniversitylevel is learning howtocommunicate it eﬀectively.
- ghow to writegood solutionstoTMA questions.
- You’ll need to carry outsome workingtoﬁnd the answer,and it’s importantthatyou include this
- what youneed to do is clearly explainhow you reachedyouranswer.
- The side opposite the rightangle in aright-angled triangle is calledthe hypotenuse –
- Pythagoras’ theorem Foraright-angledtriangle,the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sumofthe squaresofthe othertwo sides.
- whereas the authorofthe well-writtensolution haswrittenout aclear 93 s .3
- explanation of howheorshe hasreached the answer.The resultisthat the well-writtensolution is much easier fora reader to understand.
- Here aresome thingsthatyou shouldtry to do whenyou write mathematics,
- Writeinsentences.
- Explainyour reasoning.
- In the well-writtensolution,the authorhas explained howeachclaim thatheorshe makes follows from something thatwas calculated earlierinthe solution
- Use equals signs onlybetween twonumbers, quantities or algebraicexpressions that areequal.
- . When you’re carryingout acalculation thatincludesunits, it’s acceptabletoomit the unitsuntil the endofthe calculation.
-  0.32 +0.42 m= 0.25m= 0.5m.
  √ (You cansee sucha solution on page 98.) It’s acceptabletowritethis calculation as  0.32 +0.42 = 0.25 =0.5m
- Don’tuse equals signs to linkequations.
- he or she haslinkedthe equationsinthe sequence by writingequals signsbetween them.Don’t do this
- just writethe equivalent equationsunderneath each other, with no linking symbols,likethis: Solvingthe equation 0.32 +0.42 = c2 gives: 0.32 +0.42 = c2 0.25 = c2 c = ± √ 0.25 c = ±0.5.
- If youintroducenew variables,explainwhattheyare.
- If youintroducea variable thatrepresentsa physical quantity,then specify itsunits. Forexample,the authorofthe well-writtensolution hasspeciﬁednearthe beginning that l and s are lengths in metres.
- Finish with aconclusion that clearlyanswers thequestion.
- Include enough detail, but no more than is needed.
- Excessdetail canwaste your time andyourreader’s time
- Sometimesyou mightbeunsureabout howmuchdetail youneed to include,
- . As ageneral guideline, youshouldinclude enough detail to makeyoursolution cleartoa reader whose mathematical experienceisabout the same as yours.
- If there’sa worked example or an activity in the modulethat’ssimilar to aquestion thatyou’re answering, then it’s ﬁne to use the format of itssolution
- Make sure that themathematicalsymbols youuse are appropriate.
- The symbol ⇒,which means‘implies’,isoftenusedincorrectly,and it’s probably best nottouse it at all in thismodule.
- The symbol ∴ means‘therefore’and canbeuseful whenyou’re short of time,suchasinanexamination,orinrough or informal work.
  Usually,however,it’sbettertouse aword,suchas‘so’, ‘hence’ or ‘therefore’,
- Displaylargerpieces of mathematicalnotationonseparate lines.
- Include thedigit 0innumbers suchas0.3.
- Make sure that diagramsare clearand helpful.
- If youinclude adiagram –and it’s oftenuseful to do so,evenifthe question doesn’texplicitly askfor one– then makesurethatit’sneat,
- Ageometric diagram, suchasthe oneinthe well-writtensolution, doesn’tneed to be an exact scaled-down version
- Anywell-writtenTMA solution will comply with the points above, but there’s no single ‘correct way’
- In many of the TMAs forthismodule, afew marksare allocatedfor ‘good mathematical communication’.
- .Theywould alsoloseanadditional mark or half-markbecause their ﬁnalanswersdon’t include units andhence are incomplete.
- Youmightbewonderingwhetheryou shouldhandwriteyourTMA solutions, or type them.The answer is thatit’syourchoice: either is just as acceptableasthe other
- Remember,though, thatyou’re expected to handwriteyouranswersinmanymathematicsexams,soyou mightﬁnd it useful to practise in preparation forthat
- If youdoplan to type your TMAsolutions, thenyou shoulduse an equation editor to format mostofthe mathematics
- The module Essentialmathematics2 (MST125) teachesyou howtotypeset mathematics
- ,you canaccessthe MST125 teaching materials on thistopic viathe MST124 website.
