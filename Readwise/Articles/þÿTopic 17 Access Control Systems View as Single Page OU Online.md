- Category: #articles
- Summary: This text explains access control systems, focusing on methods to secure computer systems and physical access in enterprises. It discusses different types of access controls: discretionary, role-based, mandatory, and attribute-based, along with their advantages and disadvantages. The goal is to help users understand how to manage access and reduce security risks effectively.

## Highlights
- security related control categories that can be used to help identify who or what is going to be responsible for securing the system.
- Technical:
- software and hardware entities put into place to assist with keeping a system secure
- Operational:
- controls considered in this type are designed to increase individual and group system security
- The main caveat here is that operational controls are focused on people
- Managerial
- policy documents and risk-management approaches.
- Physical
- the physical deterrents and controls
- Preventive
- controls aim to prevent issues from occurring
- m preventing unauthorised access using advanced token-based or biometric authentication systems, or to prevent loss of productivity by having a good backup strategy in place to help prevent loss of data e.g. RAID setup.
- The control does not have to be technical or digital in nature
- detective controls are involved in monitoring and detecting unauthorised events within a system.
- alert system administrators to events that require human intervention
- could include CCTV and alarms
- corrective measures to get back to operational readiness. This can range from simple mechanisms such as backups (both local and off-site) to full disaster-recovery plans
- An example would be if a threat actor used social engineering methods to gain access to a physical site, then we would train security personnel to handle and detain this person once discovered.
- deterrent controls are similar to preventative controls, with the purpose that these controls should actually prevent an incident from occurring.
- many retail stores are now employing face-tracking AI- enabled technology to tackle shoplifting
- When we are discussing compensating controls we are looking at short-term, not full solutions to issues we are facing
- There can be a talent component to this in that the company does not have staff with expertise to implement
- access control is about formalising the rules that govern who is authorised to access particular data/resources and under what circumstances
- administration teams will opt to use active directory and group policy to control what roles users are assigned to
- every object has an owner, and that owner will grant access to users at their discretion.
- hard to maintain and can be a timely process if there is only one owner to review requests for permission,
- ossible human error resources could be shared with the incorrect individual
- access rights are granted based on pre-determined rules e.g. people in HR need access to the HR shared drive
- removes the personal touch element seen in DAC,
- The staff member may join other teams for projects demanding they are given access to other resources
- Second, who is auditing the role groups to ensure that they reflect the current needs of the staff in those roles?
- without good policy and audits the approach could lead to the development of issues over time.
- e secure and centralised process that grants access in the form of clearance.
- we may opt to use the labels confidential, secret, top secret and so on,
- The environment where this may be best suited can include critical infrastructure (power plants), government and military settings.
- As mentioned in the previous point where the sector is looking to have granular control of who has access to what and why, MAC is clearly the better-suited approach
- it requires an attribute (or environmental) condition to be met before granting access.
- Whereas RBAC is looking at the singular role, ABAC can adapt and change based on unique attributes being met.
- It is worth mentioning that databases are most likely to exist outside of these earlier forms of access control as they can be set up to be capable of providing their own access control
- Most modern databases will support a form of encryption.
- While a database is more of a back-end service, it will rely on some front-end entity to allow a usable experience to exist. This can be a point of weakness if not updated,
- The critical element here is that upon granting access you still need to provide credentials to access the shared data/resource
- The use of two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA) technologies is becoming more common. However, this is not without its drawbacks
- As you can see from this simple example, access control is not straightforward
- A company with high staff turnover should have regular checks for redundant accounts
