- Recall thatan operation (inthiscase, addition of complexnumbers)thatobeys the ﬁrst rule is said to be commutative,and an operation thatobeys the second rule is said to be associative.
#### 1.3Multiplying complexnumbers
- Multiplication of complexnumbers,like addition of complexnumbers,is both commutative and associative.
- Multiplication of complexnumbers is also distributive over addition of complex numbers
- When multiplyingacomplex number z by itself,you shouldwrite z2, ratherthan zz or z × z,just as forrealnumbers.
- If you’re working with the complex numbers,thenit’salsotrue thateach negative real number hastwo square roots. Forexample,the number −3 has the two square roots ±i √ 3, becau
- Square rootsofanegativereal number If d is a positive realnumber, then the square rootsof −d are ±i √ d.
#### 1.4Complex conjugation
- Complexconjugation The complex conjugate of a + bi is a − bi.
  The complexconjugateof z is denoted by z. The operation of transforming z to z is called complex conjugation.
- Notice thatif z is a realnumber, then z = z.So complexconjugation has no eﬀect on real numbers.
- Some properties of complex conjugation z +w = z +w z −w = z −w zw = z w z/w = z/w
- wheneveryou multiply a complexnumberbyits complexconjugate, youobtain arealnumber.
- (A+B)(A−B)= A2 −B2.
- Forany complexnumber z = a + bi, zz = a2 + b2.
#### 1.5Dividingcomplex numbers
- you can simplifyitby multiplyingthe topand bottomofthe fraction by the complexconjugate of the denominator.
- It isn’tpossibleto divide a complexnumberby0,just as it isn’tpossible to divide a realnumberby0.
- ,if z is anon-zero complex number, then the number 1/z is calledthe reciprocal of z.
- When you’re using complexnumbers as base numbers, you shouldbe careful to applyindexlawsonlyincases in which the indices (such as m and n above) are integers.

### 2 Geometrywithcomplex numbers
- howcomplexnumbers canberepresented by points in a plane, calledthe complexplane,
#### 2.1The complexplane
- Thecomplex plane The complex plane is a planeinwhich the complexnumber a + bi is representedbythe point(a, b).
  The horizontalaxisiscalled the real axis andthe vertical axis is calledthe imaginaryaxis.
- a unitgrid,which meansthatadjacenthorizontal lines in the grid are separated by one unit, andadjacentverticallines are alsoseparated by oneunit.
- Let’sconsiderwhathappens in the complex plane whenyou addtwo complex numbers.
- youget the complexnumberrepresented by the point (a + c, b + d).
- you can addtwo complex numbers in the complex plane by drawing(or imagining)a parallelogram, as illustrated in Figure 6. This is the parallelogram law
- So if you multiplythe complexnumberrepresented by the point(a, b)by the real number m,thenyou getthe complexnumberrepresented by the point(ma,mb)
- Complexconjugation alsohas asimple geometric interpretation in the complex plane: the number z = a − bi is the imageof z = a + bi under reﬂection in the real axis,
#### 2.2Modulus of a complex number
- e modulus (or absolute value)ofa complex number z,which is denoted by |z|,isits distance from the origin, andisa measure ofits size.
- Modulus of a complex number Let z = a + bi.The modulus |z| of z is itsdistance from the origin, given by |z| =  a2 + b2.
  The pluralof‘modulus’ is moduli.
- zz = a2 + b2.
- The expression a2 + b2 is equal to |z|2,so wehavethe useful identity zz = |z|2.
- |zw|2 = zwzw.
- Youlearned earlier that zw = z w,so |zw|2 = zwzw = zwz w = zzww = |z|2|w|2.
- Hence |zw|2 = |z|2|w|2,and taking square rootsgives the useful identity |zw| = |z||w|.
- |z| =    z ×w w    =    z w    |w|,
-    z w    = |z| |w| .
- Properties of modulus zz = |z|2 |zw| = |z||w|    z w    = |z|
- zz = |z|2 by z,
- 1 z z = |z|2
#### 2.3Argument of a complex number
- Youcan completely specify a particular complex numberbystating its modulus, thatis, itsdistance from the origininthe complexplane, together with the direction in which it liesfrom the origin.
- d by stating a particular angle
- we call an argument of the complexnumber.
- express the complexnumberina helpful form, called polarform,
- Arguments of a complex number An argument of anon-zero complex number z is an angle in radians measured anticlockwisefrom the positive real axis to the line between the originand z.
  The number 0 doesn’thaveanargument.
- In fact,you cansee thateach non-zerocomplexnumberhas inﬁnitely manyarguments, because youcan addany integermultiple of2π to an argument to obtain anotherargument
- Principal argumentofa complex number The principal argument of a non-zero complex number z is the argument of z thatliesinthe interval (−π, π]. Thisangle is denoted by Arg(z).
- In some othertexts, the principalargument is calledthe principal value of theargument
- The methodfor ﬁnding the principalargument of a complexnumberthat doesn’tlie on one ofthe axes is similar to the methodfor ﬁnding the direction of atwo-dimensional vector

- andone of itsarguments. Polarformofa complex number Anon-zero complexnumber z is in polarform if it is expressed as z = r(cos θ + i sin θ).
  Here r is the modulus of z,and θ is an argumentof z.
- To converta complex numberfrom polar form to Cartesian form youneed to work outvalues of sine andcosine.
#### 2.5Multiplication and division in polarform

Usingthese identities we obtain z w = (cos(θ − φ)+ i sin(θ − φ)).
