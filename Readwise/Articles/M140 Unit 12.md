- Recall thatan operation (inthiscase, addition of complexnumbers)thatobeys the ﬁrst rule is said to be commutative,and an operation thatobeys the second rule is said to be associative.
#### 1.3Multiplying complexnumbers
- Multiplication of complexnumbers,like addition of complexnumbers,is both commutative and associative.
- Multiplication of complexnumbers is also distributive over addition of complex numbers
- When multiplyingacomplex number z by itself,you shouldwrite z2, ratherthan zz or z × z,just as forrealnumbers.
- If you’re working with the complex numbers,thenit’salsotrue thateach negative real number hastwo square roots. Forexample,the number −3 has the two square roots ±i √ 3, becau
- Square rootsofanegativereal number If d is a positive realnumber, then the square rootsof −d are ±i √ d.
#### 1.4Complex conjugation
- Complexconjugation The complex conjugate of a + bi is a − bi.
  The complexconjugateof z is denoted by z. The operation of transforming z to z is called complex conjugation.
- Notice thatif z is a realnumber, then z = z.So complexconjugation has no eﬀect on real numbers.
- Some properties of complex conjugation z +w = z +w z −w = z −w zw = z w z/w = z/w
- wheneveryou multiply a complexnumberbyits complexconjugate, youobtain arealnumber.
- (A+B)(A−B)= A2 −B2.
- Forany complexnumber z = a + bi, zz = a2 + b2.
#### 1.5Dividingcomplex numbers
- you can simplifyitby multiplyingthe topand bottomofthe fraction by the complexconjugate of the denominator.
- It isn’tpossibleto divide a complexnumberby0,just as it isn’tpossible to divide a realnumberby0.
- ,if z is anon-zero complex number, then the number 1/z is calledthe reciprocal of z.
- When you’re using complexnumbers as base numbers, you shouldbe careful to applyindexlawsonlyincases in which the indices (such as m and n above) are integers.
