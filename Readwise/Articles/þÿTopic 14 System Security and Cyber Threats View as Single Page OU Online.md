## Highlights
- Attack vector: a path or method that enables an attack to occur, e.g. an open and insecure port,
- Threat actor: any individual or collective with an intent to cause damage, disruption or loss to a system.
- Internet-based services are under constant threat of cyber- attacks.
- HTTP attacks can cause websites to slow down or cease to function properly
- By falsely translating a domain name to the target IP address, the victim is unwittingly directed to a fake website or service
- NTP servers synchronise devices across a system,
- NTP attacks can disrupt the normal operation of a system by desynchronising the system clocks.
- So, what is network and system security? In short, it’s the requirement to keep our assets or the assets we hold for a third party in a secure manner, w
- Hacktivism:
- groups, known as hacktivists, are often thought to be driven by social or political ideologies
- Financial gain
- Corporate espionage
- Cyber terrorism
- Thrill seeking
- Cybercrime has seen a significant increase, which arguably could be associated with the ease of availability and accessibility of online tools and techniques along with forums and marketplaces where cybercriminals operate
- A threat actor will actively probe a system looking to exploit known vulnerabilities, such as open or insecure communications channels
- threats to the system can originate from inside the organisation, as well outside,
- external threats are often the most widely documented
- Internal threats come from those within the organisation with access privileges to parts of the system,
- the end user is often perceived as being the weakest link in the chain
- The risks posed to the system by the end user are either with malicious intent or – more commonly – unintentional.
- The end user can also pose a threat to the system unintentionally,
- leaving workstations unattended and losing unencrypted storage devices
- BYOD (bring your own device) is also seen to introduce security vulnerabilities,
- The approach to targeting the end user through sending scam emails to gather user credentials or gain unauthorised access to the system is referred to as phishing.
- This is often called an attack vector,
- Social engineering
- Overly complex security measures:
- End user awareness:
- Human error:
- Device security:
