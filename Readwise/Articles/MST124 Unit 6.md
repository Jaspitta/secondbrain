- Summary: The gradient of a graph represents the rate of change at each point, and it varies for different values of x. This concept applies to both straight and curved graphs, where the derivative helps find the gradient. Additionally, the second derivative provides information about the shape of the graph, indicating whether it is concave up or down.

## Highlights
- Calculus provides away of solvingmany mathematical problems thatcan’t be solved using algebraalone.
- In essence, calculus allowsyou to work with situationswhere a quantity is continuously changing and itsrate ofchangeisn’tnecessarily constant
- Calculus appliesto all situationswhere one quantity changes smoothly with respect to anotherquantity.
- Basic calculus splitsinto two halves,known as diﬀerentialcalculus and integral calculus.
- in diﬀerential calculus, you start oﬀ knowing the values taken by a changing quantity throughouta periodofchange, andyou use thisinformation to ﬁndthe values taken by the rate ofchangeofthe quantity
- In integral calculus, you carry outthe opposite processto diﬀerential calculus.
- you’vemodelledthe man’s walk by ﬁnding aformulathatexpresseshis velocity
- Integral calculus allows you touse thisinformation to deduce hisdisplacement
- the precise mathematical ideasbehind calculus are coveredinthe subject areaknown as real analysis.You might study thissubject at Level2,
### 1 Whatisdiﬀerentiation?
#### 1.1Graphs of relationships
- If agraph thatrepresentsthe relationship between twoquantitiesiscurved, then there’s no single gradientvalue thatappliesto the whole graph.
- However, the graphhas agradient at each point on the graph
- in every graphinthese units, every value onthe horizontalaxiscorresponds to at mostone value onthe vertical axis.
#### 1.2Gradients of curved graphs
- To understand what’smeant by the gradient of a curved graphata particular point, considerthe pointonthe graphof y = x2 marked in Figure 7(a).Imaginethatyou’re tracingyourpen tipalongthe graph, but when itreaches the marked pointyou justcarry on moving it in the direction in which it’s been moving
- Thisstraightline‘justtouches’the graphatthe marked point, andiscalled the tangent
- The gradient of a graphata particular pointisthe gradient of the tangentto the graphatthatpoint.
