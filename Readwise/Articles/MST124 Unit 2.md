## Highlights
- The useofmathematicstorepresent andstudyreal-lifesituationsisknown as mathematicalmodelling
- .Note thatmathematiciansoftenuse s to representdistance.
- Everyequation in twovariables, whetheritmodelsa practicalsituation or not, represents arelationshipbetween those variables. Forexample,the equation y =2x − 1
- Auseful waytovisualisea relationshipbetween twovariablesistodraw its graph.
- In thisunityou will revise twoparticular typesofequation andtheir graphs.
- In Section 1you will revise the concepts of coordinates andgraphs, and then in Sections2 and3 youwill considerequationsofthe form y = mx+ c,
- The graphofevery equation of this form is astraightline
- In Section 4, youwill considerequationsofthe form y = ax2 + bx + c,
- The graphofevery equation of thisform hasa particular curved shape calleda parabola
- Equationsofthisform canbeusedtomodel some typesofreal-life situations
### 1 Plotting graphs
#### 1.1 Coordinates
- The location of each pointina plane(thatis, on aﬂat surface) canbe speciﬁedusing apair of coordinates
- Thismethodofspecifyingthe position of points is knownasa rectangular or Cartesian coordinatesystem.
- The planeinwhich the axes andthe points lie is sometimescalled the Cartesian plane,
- ,ifa graphrepresentsthe relationshipbetween the variables s and t,thenthese letters are usedtolabel the axes.
- Whateverthe axis labelsare,the ﬁrst number in apair of coordinates is alwaysthe position alongthe horizontalaxis, andthe second number is alwaysthe position alongthe vertical axis.
#### 1.2 Graphs of equations
- Apoint(x, y)issaid to satisfy the equation if the equation is true forthe point’svalues of x and y.
- Youknowfrom Unit 1thatifa pair of values of x and y satisfy an equation in x and y,thentheyalsosatisfy anyrearrangedversion of the equation.
- If the equation hasthe property thatitcan be rearrangedtoexpress y as a formulainterms of x (so each valueof x determines justone valueof y), then the lineorcurve is calledthe graph of the equation.
- Plot the graphofthe equation y = x 2 +2.
  Solution Constructa tableofvalues.Choosesome equally-spaced values of x,and work outthe corresponding values of y by substituting into the equation.For example,substituting x = −2intothe equation gives y =(−2)/2+2= −1+2= 1.
- e everystraightlinecontinues inﬁnitely farineachdirection.A graphcan showonlya small,ﬁnite part of aline.
- Aﬁnite part of aline, suchasthe part between twoparticular points, is calleda linesegment
- Whenyou plot the graphofanequation in which onevariable y is expressedinterms of anothervariable x,the variable x is alwaysonthe horizontalaxis
- When youplot the graphofanequation using atable of values alone, you cannotbeabsolutely surethatthe graphiscorrect
- Because youcan getthe wrongideaabout the shape of agraphfrom an unfortunate choiceofplottedpoints, it’s helpful to gettoknowthe general shapesofthe graphs of some standard typesofequatio
### 2 Straight-linegraphs
#### 2.1 Gradients andintercepts of straight lines
##### Gradients
- fhow steep it is.
- The gradient (or slope)ofthe lineisthe number of units thatyourpen tipmoves up forevery oneunitthatitmoves to theright.
- It will move down by 3units forevery oneunitthatitmoves to the right. A movement of 3units down canbethought of as amovementof −3
- tslopes up from left to righthas apositivegradient.
- tslopes down from left to righthas anegativegradient.
- magnitude of anumber, which is itsvaluewithout itsminus sign, if it hasone
- alsocalled its modulus or its absolute value.
- When thecoordinateaxes have equalscales (thatis, whenthe distance representing oneunitisthe same forboththe horizontaland vertical axes), alinewithgradient 1or −1makes an angle of 45◦
- So alinewhose gradient has magnitude greater than1 makes an angle of more than45◦
##### Calculating gradients
- Youcan calculatethe gradient of astraightlinebychoosingany two points on the line
- nyou ﬁnd the number of units by which x increasesasyou traceyourpen tipfrom the ﬁrst pointtothe second point
- known as the run from the ﬁrst pointtothe second point.
- Youalsoﬁnd the number of units by which y increases
- Thisisknown as the rise
- ecan be expressedasa formulainterms of the coordinates of the twopoints on the line
##### Gradients of horizontaland vertical lines
- The gradient of ahorizontallineiszero
- the gradient of averticallineis undeﬁned.
- the runbetween anytwo points on a vertical lineiszero
##### Intercepts
- The valueof x where alinecrossesthe x-axisiscalled its x-intercept,
- andthe valueof y where it crossesthe y-axis is calledits y-intercept
#### 2.2 Straight lines andtheir equations
- Let’snow considerwhich equationsin x and y are the equationsofstraight lines
- y =2x.
- e points thatlie on the straightlinethrough the originwith gradient2,
- forany valueof m,the points (x, y)thatsatisfy the equation y = mx are the points thatlie on the straightlinethrough the originwith gradient m.
- Nowconsiderthe equation y =2x +1.Notethatifa pointsatisﬁes y =2x, then adding 1toits y-coordinategives apointthatsatisﬁes y =2x +1.
- Moving the lineupbythisamount changes its y-interceptfrom 0to1.
- The graphofthe equation y = mx+ c is the straightlinewith gradient m and y-intercept c.
- The graphofthe equation y = mx+ c is the straightlinewith gradient m and y-intercept c.
- the graphofany equation thatcan be rearrangedintothe form y = mx+ c is astraightline
- .Any equation that’softhe form y = mx+ c,orthatcan be rearrangedintothisform, is calleda linearequation
##### Equationsofhorizontaland vertical lines
- rthatthe gradient of ahorizontallineiszero
- c hasequation y =0x + c;thatis, y = c.
- A vertical linehas no gradient,
- itdoesn’t have an equation of the form y = mx+ c
- , everypointona vertical linehas the same x-coordinate
- f the form x = d.
- t d is the x-intercept.
- Equations of horizontaland verticallines Thehorizontallinewith y-intercept c hasequation y = c.
  The vertical linewith x-intercept d hasequation x = d.
##### Drawing aline from its equation
- Ifyou canrecogniseanequation as the equation of a straightline, then to draw thislineyou justneed to ﬁnd two points
- You shouldtry to choose values of x thatare reasonably far
##### Finding the equation of astraightline
- If youknowthe gradient andthe y-interceptofthe line, then youcan immediatelywritedownthe equation of the line
#### 2.3 Parallel andperpendicularlines
- Twostraightlines are parallel if they never cross,
- You mayhavenoticed from your solution to thisactivitythatthese twolines have the same gradient
- , saying thattwo non-vertical lines are parallelmeans the same as saying thattheyhavethe same gradient
- Twolines are perpendicular if they are at rightanglestoeachother.
- Hence gradient of the linethrough A and B = , q p and gradient of the linethrough A and C = p −q Multiplyingthese twogradientstogether gives q p × −  p q  = −1.
- Gradients of perpendicularlines Thegradientsofany two perpendicular lines (notparallel to the axes) have product −1.
- iftwo perpendicular lines are paralleltothe axes,thenone of them is paralleltothe y-axis andhence hasundeﬁnedgradient.
#### 2.4 Applications of straight-linegraphs
- the relationshipbetween two real-lifequantitiescan oftenbemodelledbyanequation in twovariables.
- In thissubsection,you’lllookatsome examplesoflinearmodels, and practise workingwiththem.
- s the journey of a car
- the relationshipbetween the time thathas elapsedsince the carbegan itsjourney,and the distance
- . Agraphlikethis, in which distanceisplottedagainst time,is knownasa distance–time graph.
- Youcan calculatethe gradient of the graph
- gradient = (240 − 0)km (3 − 0) h =80km/h.
- , because the numbersonthe axes of the graphhaveunits, the gradient alsohas units.
- In general, the units of the gradient of agraphare the unitsonthe vertical axis dividedbythe units on the horizontalaxis.
- in general it’s notnecessary to include units in the calculation of a gradient.You justneed to state the unitsinthe ﬁnalanswer.
- Unitssuchaskm/h,which are obtained by combiningsimplerunits (in thiscasekmand h), are called derivedunits.
- the speed of the caris80kilometres perhour. The fact thatthe graphisa straightlinetells youthatthe caris travellingata constant speed.
- , if agraphisa straightline, then it meansthatthe quantity on the vertical axis is changingata constant rate
- .Inother words, the gradient of the graphisthe rate of change of the quantity on the vertical axis with respect to the quantity on the horizontalaxis
- The intercepts of real-lifegraphs oftenhavepracticalinterpretationstoo.
- The intercepts of real-lifegraphs don’talwayshaveuseful meanings
- When you’re workingwitha linearmodel,it’susually helpful to usethe equation of the associated straight-linegraph.
##### Displacementand velocity
- nthe object’s displacement from the referencepointisits distance from thatpoint, with apositiveornegativesign to indicate the direction from thatpoint.
- Agraphlikethe oneinFigure 19,inwhich displacementisplottedagainst time,isknown as a displacement–time graph.
- The gradient of the displacement–time graph of an object moving in a straightlineiscalled the velocity of the object.Inother words, the velocity of an object is its rate of change of displacement withrespectto time.
- same as itsspeed,exceptthatithas apositiveornegativesign
- Derived units, suchaskm/h,are oftenwrittenusing indexnotation.For example,the unitkm/h canbewrittenaskmh−1
### 3 Intersectionoflines
- e pointofintersection
#### 3.1 Simultaneous equations
- Noticethat, as time goes on,the displacementofone carincreases andthe displacementofthe othercar decreases, which tells youthatthey’re travellinginoppositedirections.
- you canﬁnd accurate values by workingwiththe equationsofthe lines andusing algebra.
- o to ﬁnd the pointofintersection youhavetoﬁnd apair of values of t and s thatsatisfy both equation
- The processofﬁnding these values is knownassolvingthe equations simultaneously
- in thiscontext the twoequationsare called simultaneous equations
- Since the equations are linear equations, they’re simultaneous linearequations
- any pair of values of t and s that satisfybothequationsiscalled a solution of the simultaneous equations.
#### 3.2 Solving simultaneous equations
- and have been rearrangedsothatthe terms in the unknowns are on the left, andthe constant terms are on the right. Thisis astandard waytopresent simultaneous equations.
- Substitutionmethod
##### Substitutionmethod
- To solvesimultaneous equations: substitutionmethod 1. Rearrange oneofthe equations, if necessary,toobtain aformula forone unknown in terms of the other.
  2. Usethisformulatosubstitutefor thisunknown in the other equation.
  3. Younow have an equation in oneunknown. Solveittoﬁnd the valueofthatunknown.
  4. Substitutethisvalueintoanequation involvingbothunknowns to ﬁnd the valueofthe otherunknown.
- When yousolvesimultaneousequations, it’s ﬁne to label them (1)and (2), everytime
- s avariation of the substitution method
- If instead you start by rearranging both equationstoobtain two formulas,eachofwhich expressesone unknown (the same in both cases) in terms of the other unknown, thenyou canobtain an equation in oneunknown by equatingthe right-hand sides of both formulas.
##### Eliminationmethod
- tt
- Strategy: To solvesimultaneous equations: eliminationmethod 1. Multiply oneorbothofthe equationsbysuitablenumbers,if necessary,toobtain twoequationsthatcan be addedor subtractedtoeliminateone of the unknowns.
  2. Addorsubtractthe equationstoeliminatethisunknown.
  3. Younow have an equation in oneunknown. Solveittoﬁnd the valueofthatunknown.
  4. Substitutethisvalueintoanequation involvingbothunknowns to ﬁnd the valueofthe otherunknown.
  (Check:conﬁrmthatthe twovalues satisfy the originalequations.)
- Youshouldcheck your answerswhereverpossible,
- but youdon’t have to writethe check
#### 3.3 The numberofsolutions of simultaneous equations
- it’s alsopossiblefor apair of simultaneous linear equationstohavenosolutions, or inﬁnitely manysolutions.
- If the twolines have diﬀerent gradients, as illustrated in Figure 21(a),then theyintersect at asingle point
- If the twolines have the same gradientbut diﬀerent y-intercepts, as illustrated in Figure 21(b), thentheyare parallel
- youwill notbeabletosolvethe simultaneous equations
- y − 2x =3, y − 2x =4 have no solution;nomatterwhatvalues of x and y are chosen,itis impossiblefor y − 2x to be equal to both 3and 4.
- same gradientand the same y-intercept, as illustrated in Figure 21(c),thenthe graphs of the twoequationsare identical.
- everypointthatsatisﬁesthe ﬁrst equation alsosatisﬁesthe second equation
- if oneequation canbeobtained by rearrangingthe other.
- whenyou’re solvingsimultaneousequationsthere’s no need to start by investigatingthe number of solutions. Youcan justtry to solve the equations, andsee what happens!
### 4 Quadratics
- y = ax2 + bx + c,
- s calleda quadraticexpression,or simply a quadratic.
- ax2 + bx + c =0, (17) where a, b and c are constantsand a %=0,iscalled a quadraticequation.
#### 4.1 Quadratic graphs
- aslongas a %=0), the graphofthe equation y = ax2 + bx + c alwayshas the same type of shape,which is calleda parabola.
- positive,thenthe parabola is u-shaped,asshown in Figure 22(a).If a is negative, then it is n-shaped,
- The lowest pointona u-shapedparabola, or the highestpointonan n-shapedparabola, is calledthe vertex
- Au-shapedorn-shapedparabola canhavetwo,one or no x-intercepts,
- It alwayshas exactly one y-intercept
#### 4.2 Factorising quadratic expressions
- Factorisation of aquadratic is the reverseofthisprocess– it means writingthe quadratic as the productoftwo linearexpressions.
- You’ll seehow to factorisesucha quadratic into aproductoftwo linear expressions whosecoeﬃcients arealsointegers,
- manyquadraticswithinteger coeﬃcients can’tbe factorised using integers.
##### Factorising quadraticsinwhich x2 hascoeﬃcient1
- must be of the form (x )(x )
- , the twonumbers must multiply together to givethe constant term in the quadratic
- , the twonumbers must addtogether to givethe coeﬃcientof x
- Start by writing x2 + bx + c =(x )(x ).
  2. Find the factor pairs of c (includingbothpositiveand negative factors).
  3. Choosea factor pair with sum b.
  4. Writeyourfactorpair p, q in position: x2 + bx + c =(x + p)(x + q).
- Forsome quadratics, thisstrategydoesn’tgivea factorisation.Whenthis happens, it meansthatthe quadratic can’tbefactorised using integers
##### Factorising quadraticsinwhich x2 doesn’thavecoeﬃcient1
- o dealwiththe fact thatthere canbemore thanone possibilityfor the initial framework thatyou writeout.
- . Each pair of positive factors of the coeﬃcientof x2 gives youa possibleframework.
- youapplythe factorisation strategytoeachofthe possibleframeworksinturn, untilyou ﬁnd onethatgives youa factorisation.
- Strategy: To factorise aquadraticofthe form ax2 + bx + c 1. Take outany numerical common factors.Ifthe coeﬃcientof x2 is negative, alsotakeout the factor −1. Thenapplythe steps below to the quadratic inside the brackets.
  2. Find the positive factor pairs of a,the coeﬃcientof x2.For each suchfactorpair d, e writedowna framework (dx )(ex ).
  3. Find all the factor pairs of c,the constant term (includingboth positive andnegativefactors).
  4. Foreachframework andeachfactorpair of c,writethe factor pair in the gapsinthe framework in both possibleways.
  5. Foreachofthe resulting cases, calculatethe term in x thatyou obtain whenyou multiply outthe brackets.
  6. Identify the case where thistermis bx,ifthere is sucha case.
  Thisisthe requiredfactorisation.
##### Quadraticswith no constant term
##### Diﬀerences of twosquares
#### 4.3 Solving quadratic equations by factorisation
- the ﬁrst thing to do is to checkwhetheritcan be simpliﬁed
- • If necessary,rearrange the equation so thatall the non-zeroterms are on the same side.
  • If the coeﬃcientof x2 is negative, then multiply the equation through by −1tomakethiscoeﬃcient positive.
  • If the coeﬃcients have acommon factor, then divide the equation through by thisfactor.
  • If anyofthe coeﬃcients are fractions, thenmultiplythe equation through by asuitablenumbertoclear them.
- If the productoftwo or more numbersis0,thenatleast oneofthe numbersmust be 0.
#### 4.4 Expressinga quadratic in completed-square form
- Completing the square in aquadratic expression meansrearrangingitina particular way
- In general, to completethe square in aquadratic ax2 + bx + c,you have to rearrange it into the form a(x + r)2 + s,
- r and s are newconstants
- The rearrangedform of the quadratic is calledits completed-square form.
- Strategy: To completethe square in aquadraticofthe form x2 + bx 1. Writedown(x )2,ﬁllingthe gap with the number that’shalf of b,the coeﬃcientof x (includingits +or − sign,ofcourse).
  2. Subtractthe square of the number thatyou wroteinthe gap.
- Remember thatonceyou’vefound the completed-square form of a quadratic,you canalwayscheck thatit’scorrect by multiplyingitout.
- Strategy: To completethe square in aquadraticofthe form x2 + bx + c 1. Usethe earlierstrategytocomplete the square in the subexpression x2 + bx.
  2. Collect the constant terms.
- In fact youcan use the methodthatyou’veseen forcompleting the square in quadraticsofthe form x2 + bx to allow youtocomplete the square in anyquadratic at all
- ,where a %=1,you begin by factorisingthe coeﬃcient a outof the subexpression formedbythe terms in x2 and x
- Strategy: To completethe square in aquadraticofthe form ax2 + bx + c,where a %=1 1. Rewritethe quadratic with the coeﬃcient a takenout of the expression ax2 + bx as afactor. Thisgenerates apair of brackets.
  2. Usethe earlierstrategytocomplete the square in the simple quadratic inside the brackets. Thisgenerates asecond pair of brackets, inside the ﬁrst pair.
  3. Multiply outthe outer brackets.
  4. Collect the constant terms.

- where a, b and c are constantswith a %=0,can have two, oneorno x-intercepts.
- t everyquadratic equation hasatleast onesolution if we allow solutionsthatare complexnumbers
- you only need to considerthe solutionsofquadratic equationsthatare real numbers, which are knownastheir real solutions.
- it’sthe valueof the expression b2 − 4ac,which appears underthe square root sign in the quadratic formula, thatdetermines howmanysolutionsa quadratic equation has. The diﬀerent possibilitiesare setout in the boxbelow.The value b2 − 4ac is calledthe discriminant

#### 4.9 Sketchingquadratic graphs
- a sketch of agraphisa diagram thatgives an impression of itsshape,
- It’sdiﬀerent from a plot of agraph, which is a more accuratediagram
- it shouldbesuﬃcientlycorrect to convey the main properties
- In the case of aparabola, the keypoints are the points where it crossesthe axes,and the vertex
- Properties of the graphof y = ax2 + bx + c,where a %=0 1. The graphisa parabola with averticalaxisofsymmetry.
  2. If a is positive it is u-shaped; if a is negativeitisn-shaped.
  3. It hastwo,one or no x-intercepts.
  4. It hasone y-intercept.
- Strategy: To sketch the graphof y = ax2 + bx + c,where a %=0 1. Find whetherthe parabola is u-shapedorn-shaped.
  2. Find itsintercepts, axis of symmetryand vertex.
  3. Plot the features found, andhence sketch the parabola.
  4. Label the parabola with itsequation,intercepts andthe coordinates of the vertex.
- The axis of symmetrylieshalfwaybetween the x-intercepts. The number halfwaybetween anytwo numbers p and q is theirmean, (p + q)/2.
- The vertex liesonthe axis of symmetry.
- Youcan use the methoddemonstrated in Example 19 to sketch the graph of anyequation of the form y = ax2 + bx + c,where a %=0,
- c when thereare no x-intercepts, youneed adiﬀerent method
- oﬁrstﬁnd anytwo points on the parabola thathavethe same y-coordinate
- An alternative waytoﬁnd the vertex of the graphofanequation of the form y = ax2 + bx + c,where a %=0,istocomplete the square in the quadratic expression
- Completing the square in the right-hand side (which wasdonefor this particular expression in Example 13) gives y =2(x − 3)2 +2.
  Think aboutwhatthisform of the equation tells you. Since(x − 3)2 is a square,itcan neverbenegative, no matterwhatthe valueof x is.The leastvaluethatitcan take is 0, andittakes thisvaluewhen x =3.Sothe 181
- leastvaluethat y cantakeis y =2×0+2= 2, and y takesthisvalue when x =3.Thistells youthatthe vertex is (3, 2).
