- Summary: Displacement is the distance and direction of a point from a reference point, represented as a vector. Vectors can be expressed in terms of their components using a coordinate system, and their direction can be specified using angles. Understanding how to find a vector's magnitude and components is essential for solving physics and engineering problems.

## Highlights
- The use of equationsand the coordinates of points to investigate geometric problems is an areaofmathematicsknown as coordinate geometry
- . Youwill seehow to calculate the distance between twopoints in three dimensionsand howa three-dimensional shape,the sphere,can be representedalgebraically. Such representationsform the basisof many computergraphics systems.
- The distance anddirection of apointfrom areference pointisknown as its displacement.
### 1 Distance
#### 1.1The distance between twopointsinthe plane
- Consider anytwo points in the plane, say A(x1,y1)and B(x2,y2).
- The distance between A and B is the length of the hypotenuse of the right-angledtriangle with vertices A, B and C.
- Distance formula The distance between the points (x1,y1)and (x2,y2)is ' (x2 − x1)2 +(y2 − y1)2.
- 1.2Midpoints and perpendicularbisectors
- The collection of all points thatsatisfy a particular property is calleda locus of points. ‘Locus’ is the Latin word for‘place’.
- Sometimesitisuseful to considerthe locusofpoints thatsatisfy a property involving distance.Inthe next activity youare asked to consider the locusofpoints thatare equidistant
- tall the points thatare equidistant from the twooriginal points form astraightline
- ine, which passesthrough the point halfway alongthe line segment thatjoinsthe two original points,
- o ﬁndthe coordinates of the pointhalfwayalongthe line segment thatjoinsthe twooriginal points. Thispointiscalled the midpoin
- the x-coordinateof M is equal to the x-coordinateof A plus half of the runfrom A to B.
- Midpointformula The midpointof the line segment joiningthe points (x1,y1)and (x2,y2)is ( x1 + x2 2 , y1 + y2 2 , .
- The linethatisperpendicular to aline segment anddivides it into two equal partsiscalled its perpendicularbisector.
- tiftwo lines are perpendicular and are notparallel to the axes,thenthe productoftheir gradients is −1
- n the gradient of the perpendicular bisector of AB is −1 gradient of AB .
- The points (x, y)onthis bisector are exactly those thatare equidistant from (a, b)and (c, d); thatis, those satisfyingthe equation ' (x − a)2 +(y − b)2 = ' (x − c)2 +(y − d)2.
  So thisisthe equation of the perpendicular bisector. Youcan simplify itto obtain the equation of a lineinthe usualform.
### 2 Circles
- A circle can be deﬁned asthe locusof points thatare at a particular distancefrom aspeciﬁed point.
- The speciﬁedpointisthe centre of the circle,and the distanceisits radius.
#### 2.1The equation of a circle
- considerthe circle with centre C(4, 3) and radius2
- By the distance formula, everypoint(x, y)onthe circle satisﬁesthe equation ' (x − a)2 +(y − b)2 = r.
  Squaring thisequation to remove the square root gives the standard formofthe equation of acircle
- Standard form of the equation of acircle Thecircle with centre(a, b)and radius r hasequation (x − a)2 +(y − b)2 = r2.
- If youhavethe equation of a circle in standard form, then you can write down the centreand radius
- the equation of anycircle can be writtenasan equation with terms in x2, y2, x and y anda constant term. However, not everyequation of thisform is the equation of a circle,because notevery equation of thisform canbe rearrangedinto the form (x − a)2 +(y − b)2 = r2,
- any equation with terms as described aboveinwhich x2 and y2 have diﬀerent coeﬃcients is notthe equation of a circle.
- the equation x2 + y2 − 4x +2y +9 =0. Rearrangingthisequation by completing the squaresgives (x − 2)2 +(y +1)2 = −4.
- the equation (x − 5)2 +(y − 3)2 =0 is satisﬁedonlyby the single point(5, 3) andhence is notthe equation of a circle

- Youhaveseen thatwhen you substitute a particular value of x into the equation of a circle andsolve for y,you obtain two, one orno solutions. If thereare two solutions, thenone of them gives a pointonthe tophalf of the circle,and the othergives a pointonthe bottomhalf.Ifthere is only one solution,then itgives the pointatthe extreme left or rightofthe circle.Ifthere are no solutions, thenthere is no pointonthe circle with thatvalue of x.
- The equation of acircle,such as (x − 1)2 +(y − 5)2 =9, x (3) is said to be in implicit form,because it doesn’texpress either of the two variables x and y explicitly in terms of the othervariable.
- By contrast, an equation such as y =3x2 +2, which expressesthe variable y explicitly as a function of the other variable x,issaid to be in explicit form
#### 2.2The circle through threepoints
- ifyou choose anytwo points, then there isexactly one straightlinethatpassesthrough both of them.Thisisnot true of circles
- if youchoosea third point, then as longasthe three points do notall lie on the same straightline, thereisonlyone circle
- Consider three points A, B and C,asillustrated in Figure 13. To ﬁnd the equation of the circle passing through them,all you need to do is ﬁnd the coordinates of the centre,
- The centreofthe circle is equidistant from A, B and C.Inparticular, it is equidistant from A and B,soitlieson the perpendicular bisector of AB.
  Similarly,itisequidistant from B and C
- Strategy: To ﬁnd the equation of the circle passingthroughthree points 1. Find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of the line segment thatjoinsany pair of the three points.
  2. Find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of the line segment thatjoinsa diﬀerent pair of the three points.
  3. Find the pointofintersection of these twolines.Thisisthe centreofthe circle.
  4. Find the radiusofthe circle,which is the distance from the centreto any of the three points.
  Hencewrite downthe equation of the circle.
