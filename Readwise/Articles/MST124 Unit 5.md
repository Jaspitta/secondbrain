- Summary: Displacement is the distance and direction of a point from a reference point, represented as a vector. Vectors can be expressed in terms of their components using a coordinate system, and their direction can be specified using angles. Understanding how to find a vector's magnitude and components is essential for solving physics and engineering problems.

## Highlights
- The use of equationsand the coordinates of points to investigate geometric problems is an areaofmathematicsknown as coordinate geometry
- . Youwill seehow to calculate the distance between twopoints in three dimensionsand howa three-dimensional shape,the sphere,can be representedalgebraically. Such representationsform the basisof many computergraphics systems.
- The distance anddirection of apointfrom areference pointisknown as its displacement.
### 1 Distance
#### 1.1The distance between twopointsinthe plane
- Consider anytwo points in the plane, say A(x1,y1)and B(x2,y2).
- The distance between A and B is the length of the hypotenuse of the right-angledtriangle with vertices A, B and C.
- Distance formula The distance between the points (x1,y1)and (x2,y2)is ' (x2 − x1)2 +(y2 − y1)2.
- 1.2Midpoints and perpendicularbisectors
- The collection of all points thatsatisfy a particular property is calleda locus of points. ‘Locus’ is the Latin word for‘place’.
- Sometimesitisuseful to considerthe locusofpoints thatsatisfy a property involving distance.Inthe next activity youare asked to consider the locusofpoints thatare equidistant
- tall the points thatare equidistant from the twooriginal points form astraightline
- ine, which passesthrough the point halfway alongthe line segment thatjoinsthe two original points,
- o ﬁndthe coordinates of the pointhalfwayalongthe line segment thatjoinsthe twooriginal points. Thispointiscalled the midpoin
- the x-coordinateof M is equal to the x-coordinateof A plus half of the runfrom A to B.
- Midpointformula The midpointof the line segment joiningthe points (x1,y1)and (x2,y2)is ( x1 + x2 2 , y1 + y2 2 , .
- The linethatisperpendicular to aline segment anddivides it into two equal partsiscalled its perpendicularbisector.
- tiftwo lines are perpendicular and are notparallel to the axes,thenthe productoftheir gradients is −1
- n the gradient of the perpendicular bisector of AB is −1 gradient of AB .
- The points (x, y)onthis bisector are exactly those thatare equidistant from (a, b)and (c, d); thatis, those satisfyingthe equation ' (x − a)2 +(y − b)2 = ' (x − c)2 +(y − d)2.
  So thisisthe equation of the perpendicular bisector. Youcan simplify itto obtain the equation of a lineinthe usualform.
### 2 Circles
- A circle can be deﬁned asthe locusof points thatare at a particular distancefrom aspeciﬁed point.
- The speciﬁedpointisthe centre of the circle,and the distanceisits radius.
#### 2.1The equation of a circle
- considerthe circle with centre C(4, 3) and radius2
- By the distance formula, everypoint(x, y)onthe circle satisﬁesthe equation ' (x − a)2 +(y − b)2 = r.
  Squaring thisequation to remove the square root gives the standard formofthe equation of acircle
- Standard form of the equation of acircle Thecircle with centre(a, b)and radius r hasequation (x − a)2 +(y − b)2 = r2.
- If youhavethe equation of a circle in standard form, then you can write down the centreand radius
- the equation of anycircle can be writtenasan equation with terms in x2, y2, x and y anda constant term. However, not everyequation of thisform is the equation of a circle,because notevery equation of thisform canbe rearrangedinto the form (x − a)2 +(y − b)2 = r2,
- any equation with terms as described aboveinwhich x2 and y2 have diﬀerent coeﬃcients is notthe equation of a circle.
- the equation x2 + y2 − 4x +2y +9 =0. Rearrangingthisequation by completing the squaresgives (x − 2)2 +(y +1)2 = −4.
- the equation (x − 5)2 +(y − 3)2 =0 is satisﬁedonlyby the single point(5, 3) andhence is notthe equation of a circle

- Youhaveseen thatwhen you substitute a particular value of x into the equation of a circle andsolve for y,you obtain two, one orno solutions. If thereare two solutions, thenone of them gives a pointonthe tophalf of the circle,and the othergives a pointonthe bottomhalf.Ifthere is only one solution,then itgives the pointatthe extreme left or rightofthe circle.Ifthere are no solutions, thenthere is no pointonthe circle with thatvalue of x.
- The equation of acircle,such as (x − 1)2 +(y − 5)2 =9, x (3) is said to be in implicit form,because it doesn’texpress either of the two variables x and y explicitly in terms of the othervariable.
- By contrast, an equation such as y =3x2 +2, which expressesthe variable y explicitly as a function of the other variable x,issaid to be in explicit form
#### 2.2The circle through threepoints
- ifyou choose anytwo points, then there isexactly one straightlinethatpassesthrough both of them.Thisisnot true of circles
- if youchoosea third point, then as longasthe three points do notall lie on the same straightline, thereisonlyone circle
- Consider three points A, B and C,asillustrated in Figure 13. To ﬁnd the equation of the circle passing through them,all you need to do is ﬁnd the coordinates of the centre,
- The centreofthe circle is equidistant from A, B and C.Inparticular, it is equidistant from A and B,soitlieson the perpendicular bisector of AB.
  Similarly,itisequidistant from B and C
- Strategy: To ﬁnd the equation of the circle passingthroughthree points 1. Find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of the line segment thatjoinsany pair of the three points.
  2. Find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of the line segment thatjoinsa diﬀerent pair of the three points.
  3. Find the pointofintersection of these twolines.Thisisthe centreofthe circle.
  4. Find the radiusofthe circle,which is the distance from the centreto any of the three points.
  Hencewrite downthe equation of the circle.

##### Supply anddemand
- The lawofdemand statesthatthe lowerthe sellingprice ofthe goods, the more consumerswantto buy.
  The lawofsupply statesthatthe lowerthe sellingprice ofthe goods, the less producerswantto produce.
- The sellingpriceatwhich the supply of aparticular item from producersis equal to the demandfrom consumersiscalled the equilibrium price

### 4 Working in three dimensions
#### 4.1Three-dimensionalcoordinates
- we extend the usualtwo-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, by introducinga third axis,the z-axis,
- Althoughtwo-dimensional coordinatesystems are usually drawnwiththe positive direction of the y-axis pointing up, three-dimensional systems are usually drawnwiththe positive direction of the z-axis pointing up.
- Thisplane isknown as the x, y-plane. Similarly,the plane thatcontains the x-and z-axes is the x, z-plane, andthe plane thatcontainsthe y-and z-axes is the y, z-plane. These
- These three planes are known asthe coordinate planes.The positive direction of the z-axis is calledthe positive z-direction
- The right-handed coordinatesystemisusually usedinpreferenceto the left-handed one.
- The position of a pointinthree dimensionscan be speciﬁed by three coordinates x, y and z,
#### 4.2The distance between twopointsin three dimensions
- In the ﬁgure, the horizontalplane thatcontainsthe point A hasbeen shaded. Let C be the pointinthisplane thatliesdirectly below B,and let D be the pointinthe shadedplane such that AD is parallelto the x-axisand CD is parallelto the y-axis,asshown.
- The distance AB is the length of the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle with vertices A, B and C.So, by Pythagoras’theorem, AB2 = AC2 +BC2.
  (6) Howeverthe length AC thatappears in thisequation is itself the length of the hypotenuse of the right-angledtriangle with vertices A, C and D.So, again by Pythagoras’theorem, AC2 = AD2 +DC2.
- Usingthisequation to substitute for AC2 in equation (6)gives AB2 = AD2 +DC2 +BC2.
- AB2 =(x2 − x1)2 +(y2 − y1)2 +(z2 − z1)2.
- Distance formula(three dimensions) The distance between twopoints (x1,y1,z1)and (x2,y2,z2)is ' (x2 − x1)2 +(y2 − y1)2 +(z2 − z1)2.
#### 4.3The equation of a sphere
- . In three dimensions, the locusof points equidistant from a particular pointisa sphere.
- If a sphere hascentre(a, b, c), and(x, y, z)isany pointonthe sphere,then the distance between these two points is equal to the radius
- Thestandard formofthe equation of a sphere The sphere with centre(a, b, c)and radius r hasequation (x − a)2 +(y − b)2 +(z − c)2 = r2.
- As with the equationsofcircles, the equationsofspherescan be writtenin forms otherthanthe standard form
- x2 + y2 + z2 +2x − 6y − 4z +12 = 0.
- Not every equation with terms in x2, y2, z2, x, y, z anda constant term represents asphere
- if the coeﬃcients of x2, y2 and z2 are notall the same,then the equation does notrepresent a sphere.Similarly,the equation x2 + y2 + z2 = −1does notrepresent a sphere,because no point(x, y, x)satisﬁesthisequation.
- Non-spherical objectsthatare represented by equationswithterms in x2, y2, z2, x, y, z anda constant term include ellipsoids and hyperboloids,as illustrated in Figure 27.
### 5 Vectors
- a type of mathematical object calleda vector.
#### 5.1Whatisa vector?
- Some mathematical quantities can’tbespeciﬁedjust by stating their size – instead you need to state a size and adirection
- .The resulting quantity is calledthe velocity of the object.
- , we often need to dealwithmovementintwo or three dimensions.
- , displacement is the position of one pointrelative to another, whether in one, twoorthree dimensions.
- o speed together with direction is called velocity.
- Quantities,such asdisplacementand velocity,thathavebotha size anda direction are called vectors,or vector quantities
- f avector quantity is force.The size of a vector is usually calledits magnitude.
- quantitiesthathavesize but no direction are called scalars,or scalar quantities.
- Any vector with non-zeromagnitude canbe represented by an arrow,
- The length of the arrowrepresentsthe magnitude of the vector,
- and the direction of the arrowrepresents the direction of the vector
- three-dimensional vectors are representedby arrows in three-dimensional space
- Once you’ve chosen a scale,any two arrows with the same length andthe same direction representthe same vector
- Vectors are often denoted by lower-caseletters.We distinguish them from scalars by using abold typeface in typed text,and by underliningthemin handwrittentext
- denoted by v in print, or handwrittenas v.
- Remember to underline handwrittenvectors (and maketyped ones bold)inyourown work.
- Vectors thatrepresent displacements are sometimescalled displacement vectors
- The magnitude of a vector v is a scalar quantity.Itisdenoted by |v|,
##### Equalvectors
- two vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude andthe same direction.
##### The zerovector
- Zerovector The zerovector,denoted by 0 (bold zero),isthe vector whose magnitude is zero. It hasno direction.
- The zero vector is handwrittenas0 (zero underlined).
##### Additionofvectors
- We write −−→ PQ+ −−→ QR = −→ PR.
- .The general rule is calledthe triangle law for vectoradditio
- The sumoftwo vectors is alsocalled their resultant or resultant vector.
- Figure 34(c)gives an alternative way to add two vectors,the parallelogramlaw forvectoraddition,
- Parallelogram lawfor vector addition To ﬁnd the sum of twovectors a and b,place their tails together,and complete the resulting ﬁguretoform a parallelogram. Then a + b is the vector formedby the diagonal of the parallelogram, startingfrom the point where the tails of a and b mee
- Youcan addmore thantwo vectors together.Toadd several vectors,you place themall tipto tail,one afteranother
- Note thatyou can’tadd a vector to a scalar. Expressionssuch as v + x, where v is a vector and x is a scalar, are meaningless.
##### Negative of avector
- Negative of a vector The negative of a vector a,denoted by −a,isthe vector with the same magnitude as a,but the opposite direction.
- Forany points P and Q,the position vectors property that − −−→ PQ = −−→
- If youadd any vector a to itsnegative −a,byplacing the twovectors tip to tail in the usualway,then you getthe zero vector.

##### Subtractionofvectors
- . Subtracting anumberisthe same as adding the negative
- Vector subtraction To subtract b from a,add −b to a.
  Thatis, a − b = a +(−b).
##### Multiplicationofvectors by scalars
- Youcan multiply vectors by scalars
- Theresultant vector a + a hasthe same direction as a,but twicethe magnitude.We denoteitby 2a
- , forany non-zero realnumber m, the scalar multiple ma of a is the vector
- whose magnitude is |m| timesthe magnitude of a
- thathas the same direction as a if m is positive,and the opposite direction if m is negative
- Also, 0a = 0.
