- Summary: Functions can be visualized using mapping diagrams, which show how each input value corresponds to exactly one output value. The graph of a function represents the relationship between the input and output values, allowing us to see properties like the domain and image set. By modifying the function's rule, we can understand how its graph changes, such as translating it horizontally or altering its shape.

### 1 Functions andtheir graphs
#### 1.1 Setsofrealnumbers
- a set is acollection of objects
- Aset cancontain anynumberofobjects.
- Each object in aset is calledan element or member
- the elements of the set belong to or are in the set.
- Ifthere are justa fewelements, thenyou canlistthem, enclosingthemincurly brackets
- say‘let T be the set of all even integers’
- ‘let U be the set of all real numbersgreater than5’
- The setthatcontainsnoelementsatall is calledthe empty set
- ol ∅.
- Youcan do thisconcisely using the symbols ∈ and .∈,which mean ‘is in’and ‘is notin’,respectively
- It’s oftenuseful to construct‘newsetsout of old sets
- setwhose membersare all the objectsthatbelongto both A and B
- calledthe intersection of A and B,and is denotedby A ∩ B.
- thenyou canform anew setwhose membersare all the objectsthatbelongto either A or B (orboth). This setiscalled the union
- Youmightﬁnd it helpful to visualiseintersectionsand unionsofsetsby using diagrams like those in Figure 1, which are knownas Venn diagrams.
- Youcan form intersectionsand unionsofmore thantwo sets
- Everyset is asubsetofitself
- The setof all real numbersisdenoted by R
- Sometimesevery elementofa set A is alsoanelement of aset B.Inthis 2 1 3 Figure2 Asubsetofa set (shaded) case we saythat A is a subset of B
- tyou canvisualisethe real numbersaspoints on an inﬁnitely longstraightline, calledthe number line or the real line.
- In these kinds of diagrams,a solid dotindicatesa number that’sincluded in the set, anda hollowdot indicatesa number thatisn’tincluded
- An interval is aset of real numbersthat corresponds to apart of the number linethatyou candraw‘without lifting your penfrom the paper’
- Anumberthatliesatanend of an interval is calledan endpoin
- An interval thatincludesall of itsendpoints is said to be closed,
- one thatdoesn’tinclude anyofits endpoints is said to be open.
- An interval thatincludesone endpointand excludesanother, suchasthe interval in Figure 5, is said to be half-open (or half-closed)
- Aconvenientway to describemostintervals is to use inequalitysigns.
- ,the lesserquantityis on the smaller,pointedsideofthe sig
- The statement‘x> 2’ is calledan inequality.Ingeneral, an inequality is amathematical statement thatconsists of twoexpressionswithan inequality sign between them.A statement suchas‘1 <x ≤ 4’ is calleda doubleinequality.
- Anotheruseful waytodescribeintervals is to use interval notation
- the interval described by the double inequality 4 ≤ x< 7is denotedinintervalnotation by [4, 7)
- The square bracketindicatesan includedendpoint, andthe round bracketindicatesanexcludedone
- The square bracketindicatesan includedendpoint, andthe round bracketindicatesanexcludedone
#### 1.2 Whatisa function?
- arulethatconvertseachvalueofone variable (such as t,inthe carexample)toavalueofthe othervariable
- Sometimesthe rule associated with afunction canbeexpressedusing a formula, andsometimesitcan’t
- A function is amathematical object thatdescribes asituation
- A function consists of
- aset of allowed input values,called the domain o
- aset of values in which everyoutput valuelies, calledthe codomain of the function
- aprocess, calledthe rule of the function,for converting each input valueinto exactlyone outputvalue.
- . If afunction is denoted by f,say,thenfor anyinput value x,the corresponding outputvalueis denotedby f(x), which is read as ‘f of x’.
- Ifthe rule of thisfunction converts the input value1.2to the outputvalue60, then we write f(1.2) =60.
- Thistypeofnotation is knownas function notation.
- The variable usedtodenotethe input valueofa function is sometimes calledthe input variable.
- every valueinthe domain of afunction must have acorresponding outputvalue,
- t every valueinthe domain of afunction must have acorresponding outputvalue,
- notevery valueinthe codomain of afunction actually hasto occurasanoutput value.
- The setofvalues in the codomain of afunction that do occurasoutput values is calledthe image set
- Not only must everyvalueinthe domain of afunction have acorresponding outputvalue, given by the rule of the function,but it must have exactly one outputvalue
- a function f can’thavethe rule f(x)= ± √ x,
- Youcan visualisethe factsabout functionsdescribed abovebyusing a type of diagram knownasa mapping diagram,which is basedonVenn diagrams
- If f is afunction, and x is anyvalueinits domain,thenthe value f(x)iscalled the image of x under f,orthe valueof f at x
- f maps x to f(x).
- hfunctionswhose domainsand codomainsare sets of real numbers. Suchfunctionsare called real functions
- tospecify afunction, a domainmustbestated,aswellasa rule.Two functionswiththe same rule but diﬀerent domainsare diﬀerent functions.
#### 1.3 Specifying functions
- f(x)= x2 +1 (0 ≤ x ≤ 6)
- f(x)= x2 +1 (x ∈ [0, 6]).
- g(x)= 214 √ x (x ∈ [0,∞))
- Domainconvention Whena function is speciﬁedby just arule,it’sunderstood thatthe domain of the function is the largestpossibleset of real numbersfor which the rule is applicable.
##### Functionsspeciﬁed by equationsfor onevariable in terms of another
- Functionsdon’t have to be speciﬁedusing function notation.Sometimes it’s convenient to express afunction using an equation
- In general, anyequation thatexpressesone variable in terms of another variable speciﬁesthe rule of afunction.
- When afunction is speciﬁedusing an equation thatexpressesone variable in terms of anothervariable,the outputvariable is calledthe dependent variable
- The input variable is calledthe independent variable.
##### Piecewise-deﬁnedfunctions
- diﬀerent formulas fordiﬀerent partsofits domain.For example,you canspecify a function f as follows: f(x)=  x2 (x ≥ 0) x +5 (x< 0).
#### 1.4 Graphs of functions
- The graph of afunction f is the graphofthe equation y = f(x)
- s the set of points (x, y)inthe coordinateplanesuchthat x is in the domain of f and y = f(x).
- The graphofa function is normally drawnwiththe input numbersonthe horizontalaxisand the outputnumbers on the vertical axis.
- Where appropriate, youshouldmark the ends of the graphwithsolidorhollow dots.
- Ifyou candrawa vertical linethatcrossesa curvemore thanonce, then the curveisn’tthe graphofa function.For example,the curveinFigure 17(b) isn’tthe graph of afunction.
##### Increasing anddecreasing functions
## New highlights added October 23, 2024 at 12:44 PM
- Afunction f is increasingonthe interval I if forall values x1 and x2 in I suchthat x1 <x2, f(x1) <f(x2).
- Afunction f is decreasingonthe interval I if forall values x1 and x2 in I suchthat x1 <x2, f(x1) >f(x2).
#### 1.5 Imagesetsoffunctions
- ifyou have a graphofa function,thenyou canvisualisethe domain of the function on the horizontalaxis, as illustrated in Figure 21(a).Inthe same way, you canvisualisethe imageset of the function on the vertical axis.
- ifyou have a graphofa function,thenyou canvisualisethe domain of the function on the horizontalaxis, as illustrated in Figure 21(a).Inthe same way, you canvisualisethe imageset of the function on the vertical axis.
#### 1.6 Somestandard typesoffunctions
##### Linear functions
- f(x)= mx+ c,
- linearfunction.
- Quadratic functions
- f(x)= ax2 + bx + c,
- quadraticfunction.
##### Polynomial functions
- In general, if an expression is asum of ﬁnitely manyterms,eachofwhich is of the form axn
- n is anon-negativeinteger
- calleda polynomialexpression in x
- the function is calleda polynomialfunction.
- , √ x (which is the same as x1/2)is not apolynomial expression.
- The highestpower of the variable x in apolynomial expression or function is calledthe degree
- Quadratic functionsare polynomial functionsofdegree2
- Linearfunctionsare polynomial functionsofdegree1
- Polynomial functionsofdegrees 3, 4and 5are called cubic, quartic and quintic functions,respectively.
- we normally considerastraightlinetobea particular type of curve)
- ,the graphofevery polynomial function (withdomain R)thatisn’t aconstant function tends to inﬁnity or tends to minus inﬁnity at the left andright.
- Youcan tell whether the graphofa polynomial function tendstoinﬁnity or tendstominus inﬁnity at each endbylooking at the term in itsrule thathas the highestpower of x.Thistermiscalled the dominantterm,
##### Themodulus function
- The modulus function hasa graphthat’ssmoothexceptatone point
- , the modulus of arealnumber(alsoknown as its magnitude or absolute value)isits ‘distance from zero
- The modulus function is f(x)= |x|.
##### Thereciprocalfunction
- If acurve hasthe property that, as youtraceyourpen tipalongitfurther andfurtherfrom the origin, it gets arbitrarilyclose to astraightline, then thatlineiscalled an asymptote of the curve
- .Asymptotesare oftendrawn as dashedlines on graphs, when theydon’t coincide with the coordinateaxes.
##### Rationalfunctions
- The reciprocal function andall polynomial functionsare particular examplesof rationalfunctions.Ingeneral, a rational function is a function whose rule is of the form
- f(x)= p(x) q(x) , where p and q are polynomial functions.
- Everyrational function hasa graphthatconsists of oneormore pieces,
### 2 New functions from oldfunctions
#### 2.1 Translatingthe graphs of functions
- whathappens to the graphofa function when youadd aconstant
- The eﬀectsthatyou sawinActivity18are examplesof translations of graphs. Translating ashape meansslidingittoa diﬀerent position, without rotatingorreﬂectingit, or distortingitinany way.
- There’s anotherfairlysimple change thatyou canmaketothe rule of a function,which causesits graphtobetranslated horizontally
- Todothis, youreplaceeachoccurrenceofthe input variable x in the right-hand side of the rule of the function by an expression of the form x − c
- let’sthink aboutwhathappens whenyou translatethe graphofa particular function to the rightby c units
## New highlights added October 29, 2024 at 2:14 PM
- Translations of graphs Supposethat f is afunction and c is aconstant.Toobtain the graph of: • y = f(x)+ c,translatethe graphof y = f(x)upby c units (the translation is down if c is negative) • y = f(x − c), translatethe graphof y = f(x)tothe rightby c units (the translation is to the left if c is negative).
- y = f(x − c)+ d, and the originalgraphistranslated to the rightby c units andupby d units.
#### 2.2 Scalingthe graphs of functions vertically
- n when youmultiplythe right-hand side of itsrulebya constant.The new function thatyou obtain is calleda constant multiple
- The eﬀectsthatyou sawinActivity22are called verticalscalings. Scaling agraph vertically by a factor of c meansthe following.
- If c is positive,thenmoveeachpointonthe graphvertically,inthe direction away from the x-axis,until it’s c timesasfar from the x-axis
- If c is negative, then move each pointonthe graphvertically,inthe direction away from the x-axis,until it’s |c| timesasfar from the x-axis as it wasbefore,
- If c is zero, then move each pointonthe graphvertically untilitlies on the x-axis.
- Vertical scalings of graphs Supposethat c is aconstant.Toobtain the graphof y = cf(x), scale the graphof y = f(x)vertically by afactorof c.
- Youcan combineverticalscalings of graphs with vertical and/or horizontal translationsofgraphs
- When youcombine vertical scalingsand translationsinthisway,the order in which youcarry outthe changestothe rule of the function does often matter.
- Thistells youthe following enlightening fact:the graphofany quadratic function is the same basicshape as the graphof y = x2,but scaled vertically,and thentranslated horizontally and/or vertically.
#### 2.3 Scalingthe graphs of functions horizontally
- you replaceeachoccurrenceofthe input variable x in the right-hand side of the rule of the function by an expression of the form x/c,where c is aconstant
- e called horizontal scalings. Scaling agraph horizontally by a factor of c meansthe following.
- If c is positive,thenmoveeachpointonthe graphhorizontally,inthe direction away from the y-axis,until it’s c timesasfar from the y-axis as it wasbefore.
  • If c is negative, then move each pointonthe graphhorizontally,inthe direction away from the y-axis,until it’s |c| timesasfar from the y-axis as it wasbefore,and thenreﬂect it in the y-axis.
  • If c is zero, then move each pointonthe graphhorizontally untilitlies on the y-axis.
- Horizontal scalings of graphs Supposethat c is anon-zeroconstant.Toobtain the graphof y = f x , c scale the graphof y = f(x)horizontally by afactorof c.
- Reﬂectionsofgraphsinthe coordinate axes To obtain the graphof y = −f(x), reﬂect the graphof y = f(x)inthe x-axis.
  To obtain the graphof y = f(−x), reﬂect the graphof y = f(x)inthe y-axis.
### 3 Morenew functions from old functions
#### 3.1 Sums, diﬀerences,products andquotientsof functions
- The sum of f and g hasthe rule h(x)= f(x)+ g(x).
- There are two diﬀerences of f and g,withrules h(x)= f(x) − g(x) and h(x)= g(x) − f(x).
- The product of f and g hasthe rule h(x)= f(x)g(x).
- There are two quotients of f and g,withrules h(x)= f(x) g(x) and h(x)= g(x) f(x) .
- 3.2 Composite functions
#### 3.2 Composite functions
- oapplyone function afterthe other.
- dwhose domain is the largestset of real numberstowhich youcan applythe process, is calleda compositefunction
- n,orjust composite,
- te,of f and g.It’sdenoted by g ◦ f (the symbol ◦ is read as ‘circle’)
- Compositefunctions Supposethat f and g are functions. The compositefunction g ◦ f is the function whose rule is (g ◦ f)(x)= g(f(x)), andwhose domain consists of all the values x in the domain of f such that f(x)isinthe domain of g.
- The processofforming acompositefunction from twofunctionsiscalled composing the functions
#### 3.3 Inverse functions
- Anotherway to think of the inversefunction f−1 of afunction f is that f−1 ‘undoes’
- If youreverse the directionsofall the arrows in the fullversion of this mapping diagram, then the new diagram thatyou get isn’tthe mapping diagramofa function
- Afunction forwhich this doesn’t happen,and which therefore does have an inversefunction,issaid to be one-to-one.
- One-to-one functions Afunction f is one-to-one if forall values x1 and x2 in itsdomain suchthat x1 .= x2, f(x1) .= f(x2).
- ifyou draw anyhorizontal linethatcrossesthe graphofthe function,thenitcrossesit exactlyonce,
- Ifyou candrawa horizontallinethatcrosses agraphmore thanonce, then the graphisn’tthe graphofa one-to-one
- Onlyone-to-one functionshaveinverse functions.
- Afunction thathas an inversefunction is said to be invertible.
- If f is anyone-to-one function,thenthe domain of f−1 is the imageset of the original function f
- Inversefunctions Supposethat f is aone-to-one function,withdomain A andimage set B.Thenthe inverse function,orsimply inverse,of f,denoted by f−1,isthe function with domain B whose rule is given by f−1(y)= x, where f(x)= y.
  The imageset of f−1 is A.
- Strategy: To ﬁndthe ruleofthe inversefunction of aone-to-one function f • Write y = f(x)and rearrange thisequation to express x in terms of y.
  • Usethe resulting equation x = f−1(y)towritedownthe rule of f−1.(Usually,changethe input variable from y to x.)
- .Rememberthattofully specify the function f−1,you alsohavetoindicate itsdomain,
- If afunction is either increasing on itswhole domain,ordecreasing on itswhole domain,thenitisone-to-one andsohas an inversefunction.
- Ifa function f hasan inversefunction f−1,then f−1 alsohas an inversefunction,namely f.In otherwords, f and f−1 are inverses of each other
- Forany pair of inversefunctions f and f−1, (f−1 ◦ f)(x)= x, forevery value x in the domain of f,and (f ◦ f−1)(x)= x, forevery value x in the domain of f−1.
- When you’re workingwiththe notation f−1,where f is afunction,it’s importanttoappreciatethatit doesn’t mean the function g with rule g(x)=(f(x))−1; thatis, g(x)= 1 f(x) .
- Thisfunction g is calledthe reciprocal
- Graphs of inversefunctions
- for anypair of inversefunctions f and f−1,ifyou swap the coordinates of anypointonthe graphof f,thenyou’llget the coordinates of apointonthe graphof f−1,and vice versa
- Thegraphs of apair of inversefunctionsare the reﬂectionsofeach otherinthe line y = x (when the coordinateaxes have equal scales).
##### Functionsthataren’tone-to-one
- Startingwiththe function f that’snot one-to-one,wespecify anew function thathas the same rule as f,but asmallerdomain.
- • the newfunction is one-to-one and therefore hasaninverse
- the imageset of the new function is the same as the imageset of the originalfunction
- Afunction that’sobtained from anotherfunction f by keepingthe rule the same but removing some numbersfrom the domain is calleda restriction
- When youwanttorestrictthe domain of afunction thatisn’tone-to-one to enable youtoﬁnd an inversefunction,there’s alwaysmore thanone possibility

### 4 Exponential functions andlogarithms
#### 4.1 Exponential functions
- An exponentialfunction is afunction whose rule is of the form f(x)= bx,
- The number b is calledthe base number,orjust base
- Noticethat f(0)=20 =1,which explainswhy the y-interceptis1.
##### Theexponentialfunction
- In Activity 41 youshouldhavefound thatthe valueof b that gives a gradient of 1at(0, 1) seemstobeabout 2.7.
- special number,usually denotedbythe letter e,whose ﬁrst fewdigitsare 2.718 28 .
- So the exponential function with the rule f(x)= ex hasthe special property thatits gradient is exactly 1atthe point(0, 1)
- referredtoas the exponentialfunction.
- ex is sometimeswrittenasexpx,orexp(x).
- The useofthe letter e forthe base of the exponential function was introduced by Leonhard Euler (see page 214).
#### 4.2 Whatisa logarithm?
- The ﬁrst thing to remember aboutlogarithmsisthatwheneveryou’re workingwiththem, you’re alwaysusing logarithmstoa particular base
- Let’sstart by considering logarithms to base 10, which are knownas commonlogarithms.
- The logarithm to base 10 of anumber x
- The logarithm to base 10 of anumber x is denotedbylog10 x
- The logarithm to base b of anumber x,denoted by logb x,isthe powertowhich the base b must be raised to givethe number x.So the twoequations y =logb x and x = by
- the base b must be positive andnot equal to 1
- only positive numbershavelogarithms, but logarithms themselvescan be anynumber.
- Logarithm of the number 1and logarithm of the base Forany base b, logb 1= 0 and logb b =1.
- The mostcommon choices forthe base of logarithmsare 10, 2and e.
- , logarithmsto base e turnout to be easier to work with in manywaysthanlogarithmsto anyother base.
- Logarithmstobase e are called naturallogarithms
- Natural logarithms
- The naturallogarithm of anumber x,denoted by ln x,isthe power to which the base e must be raised to givethe number x.Sothe two equations y =lnx and x = ey are equivalent.
- The natural logarithm of anumber x is sometimesdenoted by log x,rather thanbyln x or loge x.
- wherever yousee the notation log x used, it’s importanttocheck itsmeaning
#### 4.3 Logarithmic functions
- A logarithmic function is afunction whose rule is of the form f(x)=logb x,
- b is apositiveconstant,not equal to 1. The number b is calledthe base or base number
- Graphs of logarithmic functions Thegraphofthe function f(x)=logb x,where b> 0and b .=1,has the following features.
  • The graphliesentirely to the rightofthe y-axis.
  • If b> 1, then the graphisincreasing, anditgetslesssteep as x increases.
  • If 0 <b < 1, then the graphisdecreasing,and it gets less steep as x increases.
  • The y-axis is an asymptote.
  • The x-interceptis1.
  • The closer the valueof b is to 1, the steeperisthe graph.
#### 4.4 Logarithmlaws
- These laws are reallyjust the same as the following three indexlaws
- ThreeindexlawsfromUnit1 bmbn = bm+n bm bn = bm−n Here arethe three logarithm laws.
  Threelogarithm laws logb x +logb y =logb (xy) logb x − logb y =logb (bm)n = bmn   x y r logb x =logb (xr)
- the base b of the logarithmscan be anypositivenumber except1,the numbers x and y must be positive
- r canbeany number
- Solving exponential equations An exponentialequation is oneinwhich the unknownisinthe exponent, such as 5x =130.
- Youcan solveexponential equationsbyusing the third of the three logarithm laws given earlierinthissubsectio
- 1.53x =22.5 Take the natural logarithm of both sides.
  ln(1.53x)=ln22.5 Usethe fact thatln(xr)= r ln x.
  3x ln 1.5= ln 22.5
- The crucial stepinthe methoddemonstrated in Example 9isto‘take logs of both sides’
#### 4.5 Alternative form forexponential functions
- Anyexponential function f(x)= bx,where b is apositiveconstant notequal to 1, canbewritteninthe alternative form f(x)= ekx, where k is anon-zeroconstant.The constant k is given by k =ln b.
- An exponentialfunction is afunction whose rule is of the form f(x)= ekx,
- .Thisalternative form is the onethat’s usually usedinuniversity-levelmathematics, as it turns outtobeeasierto work with,
- The graphliesentirely abovethe x-axis.
- If k> 0, then the graphisincreasing, anditgetssteeper as x increases.
  • If k< 0, then the graphisdecreasing,and it gets less steep as x increases.
- The x-axisisanasymptote
- The y-interceptis1.
- The closer the valueof k is to 0, the ﬂatteristhe graph.
- The graphofevery exponential function is ahorizontalscalingofthe graphofthe exponential function f(x)= ex.
- It follows thatthe graphs of all logarithmic functionsare vertical scalings of each other
#### 4.6 Exponential models
- From your work in Subsection 2.2,you know thatthe graphofthe function f(x)= aekx is obtained by vertically scaling the graphofthe function g(x)= ekx
- the function g(x)= ekx is itself obtained by horizontally scaling the graphofthe function h(x)= ex by afactorof1/k
- Aquantitythatchanges in away thatcan be modelledbya function whose rule is of the form f(x)= aekx,where a and k are non-zero constants, is said to change exponentially
- y is said to grow exponentially,the function is calledan exponentialgrowthfunction,and the graphiscalled an exponentialgrowthcurve.
- if a is positive as before but k is negative
- quantity is said to decayexponentially,the function is calledan exponentialdecayfunction,and the graphiscalled an exponential decaycurve.
- An example of areal-lifesituation thatcan oftenbemodelledbyan exponential decayfunction is the concentration of aprescription drug in a patient’sbloodstream.

- e levelof radioactivity in asample of radioactive material,
- e size of apopulation of organisms,
- .If f is sucha function,and youstart with anyvalueof x and add anumbertoit, then the valueof f(x)is multiplied by afactor. Thisfactor doesn’tdependonthe valueof x thatyou started with, butonlyonthe number thatyou added.
- Acharacteristicpropertyofexponential growth anddecay functions If f(x)= aekx,thenwhenever p units are addedtothe valueof x,the valueof f(x)ismultipliedby ekp.
- Forany exponential function f,the factor by which f(x)ismultiplied whena particular amount is addedtothe valueof x is calleda growth factor or a decayfactor
- The characteristicproperty of exponential growthand decayfunctionsin the boxabove gives us auseful waytodescribehow quicklya particular instanceofexponential growthordecayistakingplace.
- Doublingand halvingperiods Supposethat f is an exponential growthfunction.Then p is the doublingperiod of f if wheneveryou add p to x,the valueof f(x) doubles.
  Similarly,supposethat f is an exponential decayfunction.Then p is the halving period of f if wheneveryou add p to x,the valueof f(x)halves.
- Strategy: To ﬁnda doublingorhalvingperiod If f(x)= aekx is an exponential growthfunction (so k> 0),thenthe doublingperiodof f is the solution p of the equation ekp =2;thatis, p =(ln 2)/k.
  Similarly,if f(x)= aekx is an exponential decayfunction (so k< 0), then the halvingperiodof f is the solution p of the equation ekp = 1 (c) everycentury?
  2 ; thatis, p =(ln 1 2)/k = −(ln2)/k.
- doubling or halvingtime.Inthe particular case of radioactive decay, the halving time is usually calledthe half-life.
### 5 Inequalities
- Whereas an equation expressesthe fact thattwo quantities are equal, an inequality expressesthe fact thatone quantity is greater than, less than, greater thanorequal to,orlessthanorequal to,another quantity.
#### 5.1 Terminology forinequalities
- an inequality is the same as an equation,exceptthatinstead of an equals sign it containsone of the four inequality signs, <, ≤, > and ≥.
- Inequalitysigns < is less than ≤ is less thanorequal to > is greater than ≥ is greater thanorequal to
- Much of the terminology thatappliestoequationsalsoappliesto inequalities
- the solutions of an inequality are the values of itsvariablesthat satisfy it
- Mostinequalities have either inﬁnitely manysolutionsornosolutions
- tospecify all the solutionsofaninequality is to state the set thattheyform. Thisset is calledthe solution set of the inequality.
- 5.2 Rearranging inequalities
#### 5.2 Rearranging inequalities
- Rearranginginequalities Carryingout anyofthe following operationsonaninequality gives an equivalent inequality.
  • Rearrange the expressionsonone or both sides.
  • Swap the sides, provided you reverse theinequality sign.
  • Do anyofthe following thingstobothsides: – addorsubtractsomething – multiply or divide by something that’spositive – multiply or divide by something that’snegative, provided you reverse theinequality sign.
- When you’re rearranginganinequality,you shouldnot multiply or divide both sides by avariable,orbyanexpression containinga variable,unless youknowthatthe variable or expression takesonlypositivevalues or takes only negativevalues.
#### 5.3 Linearinequalities
- ,a linearinequalityinone unknown is the same as a linearequation
#### 5.4 Quadratic inequalities
- aninequality that’sthe same as aquadratic equation
- get all the terms on onesideofthe inequality sign,leaving just the number zeroon the otherside
- As youbecome more familiar with the methodinExample 13, youmight ﬁnd thatyou don’tneed to sketch the graph
- youcan alwaysmakesurethatthe coeﬃcientof x2 is positive by,ifnecessary,multiplying the inequality through by −1
