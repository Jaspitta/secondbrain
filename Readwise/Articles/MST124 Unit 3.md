- Summary: Functions can be visualized using mapping diagrams, which show how each input value corresponds to exactly one output value. The graph of a function represents the relationship between the input and output values, allowing us to see properties like the domain and image set. By modifying the function's rule, we can understand how its graph changes, such as translating it horizontally or altering its shape.

- Wheneverone quantity depends on another, we saythatthe ﬁrst quantity is a function of the secondquantity
### 1 Functions andtheir graphs
#### 1.1 Setsofrealnumbers
- a set is acollection of objects
- Aset cancontain anynumberofobjects.
- Each object in aset is calledan element or member
- the elements of the set belong to or are in the set.
- Ifthere are justa fewelements, thenyou canlistthem, enclosingthemincurly brackets
- say‘let T be the set of all even integers’
- ‘let U be the set of all real numbersgreater than5’
- The setthatcontainsnoelementsatall is calledthe empty set
- ol ∅.
- Youcan do thisconcisely using the symbols ∈ and .∈,which mean ‘is in’and ‘is notin’,respectively
- It’s oftenuseful to construct‘newsetsout of old sets
- setwhose membersare all the objectsthatbelongto both A and B
- calledthe intersection of A and B,and is denotedby A ∩ B.
- thenyou canform anew setwhose membersare all the objectsthatbelongto either A or B (orboth). This setiscalled the union
- Youmightﬁnd it helpful to visualiseintersectionsand unionsofsetsby using diagrams like those in Figure 1, which are knownas Venn diagrams.
- Youcan form intersectionsand unionsofmore thantwo sets
- Everyset is asubsetofitself
- The setof all real numbersisdenoted by R
- Sometimesevery elementofa set A is alsoanelement of aset B.Inthis 2 1 3 Figure2 Asubsetofa set (shaded) case we saythat A is a subset of B
- tyou canvisualisethe real numbersaspoints on an inﬁnitely longstraightline, calledthe number line or the real line.
- In these kinds of diagrams,a solid dotindicatesa number that’sincluded in the set, anda hollowdot indicatesa number thatisn’tincluded
- An interval is aset of real numbersthat corresponds to apart of the number linethatyou candraw‘without lifting your penfrom the paper’
- Anumberthatliesatanend of an interval is calledan endpoin
- An interval thatincludesall of itsendpoints is said to be closed,
- one thatdoesn’tinclude anyofits endpoints is said to be open.
- An interval thatincludesone endpointand excludesanother, suchasthe interval in Figure 5, is said to be half-open (or half-closed)
- Aconvenientway to describemostintervals is to use inequalitysigns.
- ,the lesserquantityis on the smaller,pointedsideofthe sig
- The statement‘x> 2’ is calledan inequality.Ingeneral, an inequality is amathematical statement thatconsists of twoexpressionswithan inequality sign between them.A statement suchas‘1 <x ≤ 4’ is calleda doubleinequality.
- Anotheruseful waytodescribeintervals is to use interval notation
- the interval described by the double inequality 4 ≤ x< 7is denotedinintervalnotation by [4, 7)

#### 1.2 Whatisa function?
- arulethatconvertseachvalueofone variable (such as t,inthe carexample)toavalueofthe othervariable
- Sometimesthe rule associated with afunction canbeexpressedusing a formula, andsometimesitcan’t
- A function is amathematical object thatdescribes asituation
- A function consists of
- aset of allowed input values,called the domain o
- aset of values in which everyoutput valuelies, calledthe codomain of the function
- aprocess, calledthe rule of the function,for converting each input valueinto exactlyone outputvalue.
- . If afunction is denoted by f,say,thenfor anyinput value x,the corresponding outputvalueis denotedby f(x), which is read as ‘f of x’.
- Ifthe rule of thisfunction converts the input value1.2to the outputvalue60, then we write f(1.2) =60.
- Thistypeofnotation is knownas function notation.
- The variable usedtodenotethe input valueofa function is sometimes calledthe input variable.
- every valueinthe domain of afunction must have acorresponding outputvalue,
- t every valueinthe domain of afunction must have acorresponding outputvalue,
- notevery valueinthe codomain of afunction actually hasto occurasanoutput value.
- The setofvalues in the codomain of afunction that do occurasoutput values is calledthe image set
- Not only must everyvalueinthe domain of afunction have acorresponding outputvalue, given by the rule of the function,but it must have exactly one outputvalue
- a function f can’thavethe rule f(x)= ± √ x,
- Youcan visualisethe factsabout functionsdescribed abovebyusing a type of diagram knownasa mapping diagram,which is basedonVenn diagrams
- If f is afunction, and x is anyvalueinits domain,thenthe value f(x)iscalled the image of x under f,orthe valueof f at x
- f maps x to f(x).
- hfunctionswhose domainsand codomainsare sets of real numbers. Suchfunctionsare called real functions
- tospecify afunction, a domainmustbestated,aswellasa rule.Two functionswiththe same rule but diﬀerent domainsare diﬀerent functions.
#### 1.3 Specifying functions
- f(x)= x2 +1 (0 ≤ x ≤ 6)
- f(x)= x2 +1 (x ∈ [0, 6]).
- g(x)= 214 √ x (x ∈ [0,∞))
- Domainconvention Whena function is speciﬁedby just arule,it’sunderstood thatthe domain of the function is the largestpossibleset of real numbersfor which the rule is applicable.
##### Functionsspeciﬁed by equationsfor onevariable in terms of another
- Functionsdon’t have to be speciﬁedusing function notation.Sometimes it’s convenient to express afunction using an equation
- In general, anyequation thatexpressesone variable in terms of another variable speciﬁesthe rule of afunction.
- When afunction is speciﬁedusing an equation thatexpressesone variable in terms of anothervariable,the outputvariable is calledthe dependent variable
- The input variable is calledthe independent variable.
##### Piecewise-deﬁnedfunctions
- diﬀerent formulas fordiﬀerent partsofits domain.For example,you canspecify a function f as follows: f(x)=  x2 (x ≥ 0) x +5 (x< 0).
#### 1.4 Graphs of functions
- The graph of afunction f is the graphofthe equation y = f(x)
- s the set of points (x, y)inthe coordinateplanesuchthat x is in the domain of f and y = f(x).
- The graphofa function is normally drawnwiththe input numbersonthe horizontalaxisand the outputnumbers on the vertical axis.
- Where appropriate, youshouldmark the ends of the graphwithsolidorhollow dots.
- Ifyou candrawa vertical linethatcrossesa curvemore thanonce, then the curveisn’tthe graphofa function.For example,the curveinFigure 17(b) isn’tthe graph of afunction.
##### Increasing anddecreasing functions
## New highlights added October 23, 2024 at 12:44 PM
- Afunction f is increasingonthe interval I if forall values x1 and x2 in I suchthat x1 <x2, f(x1) <f(x2).
- Afunction f is decreasingonthe interval I if forall values x1 and x2 in I suchthat x1 <x2, f(x1) >f(x2).
#### 1.5 Imagesetsoffunctions
- ifyou have a graphofa function,thenyou canvisualisethe domain of the function on the horizontalaxis, as illustrated in Figure 21(a).Inthe same way, you canvisualisethe imageset of the function on the vertical axis.

#### 1.6 Somestandard typesoffunctions
##### Linear functions
- f(x)= mx+ c,
- linearfunction.
- Quadratic functions
- f(x)= ax2 + bx + c,
- quadraticfunction.
##### Polynomial functions
- In general, if an expression is asum of ﬁnitely manyterms,eachofwhich is of the form axn
- n is anon-negativeinteger
- calleda polynomialexpression in x
- the function is calleda polynomialfunction.
- , √ x (which is the same as x1/2)is not apolynomial expression.
- The highestpower of the variable x in apolynomial expression or function is calledthe degree
- Quadratic functionsare polynomial functionsofdegree2
- Linearfunctionsare polynomial functionsofdegree1
- Polynomial functionsofdegrees 3, 4and 5are called cubic, quartic and quintic functions,respectively.
- we normally considerastraightlinetobea particular type of curve)
- ,the graphofevery polynomial function (withdomain R)thatisn’t aconstant function tends to inﬁnity or tends to minus inﬁnity at the left andright.
- Youcan tell whether the graphofa polynomial function tendstoinﬁnity or tendstominus inﬁnity at each endbylooking at the term in itsrule thathas the highestpower of x.Thistermiscalled the dominantterm,
##### Themodulus function
- The modulus function hasa graphthat’ssmoothexceptatone point
- , the modulus of arealnumber(alsoknown as its magnitude or absolute value)isits ‘distance from zero
- The modulus function is f(x)= |x|.
##### Thereciprocalfunction
- If acurve hasthe property that, as youtraceyourpen tipalongitfurther andfurtherfrom the origin, it gets arbitrarilyclose to astraightline, then thatlineiscalled an asymptote of the curve
- .Asymptotesare oftendrawn as dashedlines on graphs, when theydon’t coincide with the coordinateaxes.
##### Rationalfunctions
- The reciprocal function andall polynomial functionsare particular examplesof rationalfunctions.Ingeneral, a rational function is a function whose rule is of the form
- f(x)= p(x) q(x) , where p and q are polynomial functions.
- Everyrational function hasa graphthatconsists of oneormore pieces,
### 2 New functions from oldfunctions
#### 2.1 Translatingthe graphs of functions
- whathappens to the graphofa function when youadd aconstant
- The eﬀectsthatyou sawinActivity18are examplesof translations of graphs. Translating ashape meansslidingittoa diﬀerent position, without rotatingorreﬂectingit, or distortingitinany way.
- There’s anotherfairlysimple change thatyou canmaketothe rule of a function,which causesits graphtobetranslated horizontally
- Todothis, youreplaceeachoccurrenceofthe input variable x in the right-hand side of the rule of the function by an expression of the form x − c
- let’sthink aboutwhathappens whenyou translatethe graphofa particular function to the rightby c units
