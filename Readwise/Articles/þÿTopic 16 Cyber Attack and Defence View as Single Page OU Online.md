- Category: #articles
- Summary: This topic covers the different methods of cyber-attacks and the importance of understanding them to secure networks. It distinguishes between passive attacks, which gather information without detection, and active attacks, which harm data and disrupt operations. The discussion also includes various defense methods to protect systems from these threats.

## Highlights
- depending on whether they are passive or active.
- active attacks are aimed to cause maximum impact
- passive attacks the intent is to go unnoticed
- focused on unauthorised access
- The primary goal is to monitor the system and gather sensitive information without alerting the victim
- insert a backdoor
- disrupt normal business operations
- methods or routes that a threat actor can use
- Understanding the potential attack vectors on a system allows the cybersecurity specialist to better plan
- Brute force:
- guess the password
- trial and error by manually cycling
- Code injection
- Command injection:
- allowing the threat actor to call system-level functions
- DoS:
- interfere or halt the normal operation
- by exhausting the available resources
- DDoS:
- launched from multiple devices,
- Compromised devices are known as Bots, and operate as a network of Bots or a Botnet.
- Identify focused attack
- Insider threat:
- a disgruntled employee seeking to disrupt normal system
- IoT focused:
- IoT devices, known as nodes, have limited onboard resources and are inherently insecure
- Social engineering:
- attempting to exploit the user
- Spoofing:
- falsifying or deceiving, typically to gain an advantage or trick someone
- Phishing:
- One of the various social engineering techniques
- Monitoring:
- Malware:
- malicious software
- Viruse
- replicate themselves by attaching to other programs or files.
- virus spreads when the infected program is executed;
- Worms:
- doesn’t need a host program to propagate
- Trojan horses:
- disguised as legitimate software
- Rootkits:
- tools used by the threat actor to gain root (administrator) privilege
- Software vulnerabilities:
- buffer overflow, w
- Zero-day exploits:
- potential vulnerabilities in newly released operating system updates or software applications
- , cybersecurity specialists can plan and implement effective mitigation and defence systems.
- the OS is the focus of many cyber-attacks due to its critical role i
- altering its default settings to better protect against external and internal threats.
- m hardening is the implementation of security patches
- Patches
- are essentially code updates provided by operating system manufacturers to protect against newly discovered threats
- Firewalls
- program that is designed to allow network traffic either in or out of the network or an operating system
- permit or deny access.
- A host-based intrusion-detection system (HIDS) is a security system that monitors and analyses the internal state of a computing system rather than network traffic
- File integrity:
- System calls
- Server logs:
- System user activity:
- Any non-essential services or ports should be made unusable
- A VPN (virtual private network) can be created to generate a secure connection between remote users, or remote sites
- The VPN encryption hides the data in transit from plain sight,
- setting and enforcing permissions that state who can access, change, delete or execute a file
- File and data encryption i
- For system administrators, it is extremely useful to have a record of operating system events.
- This is also important for determining if a security breach has come from inside or outside of the system
- Windows uses a tool called Event Viewer (Figure 3) while macOS uses an application called Console
- Linux logs are kept in the /var/log directory
- /var/log/messages – contains all kernel-related information /var/log/auth.log – contains system authorisation information /var/log/boot.log – contains information that is logged when the system boots up /var/log/daemon.log – contains information logged by various background daemons.
