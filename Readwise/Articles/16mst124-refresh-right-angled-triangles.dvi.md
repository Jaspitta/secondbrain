- Summary: Right-angled triangles that share a common angle are similar and have equal ratios of corresponding side lengths. The three basic trigonometric ratios—sine, cosine, and tangent—help calculate these lengths and angles. It's essential to know whether your calculator is set to degrees or radians when finding the values of these ratios.

## Highlights
- the ratio of the lengths of any one pair of sides in one triangle is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the corresponding sides in the other triangle
- Two similar triangles have the same three angles.
- called the trigonometric ratios
- three basic trigonometric ratios
