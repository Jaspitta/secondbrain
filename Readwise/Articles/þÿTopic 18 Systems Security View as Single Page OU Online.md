- Category: #articles
- Summary: This topic covers systems security, focusing on protecting computer systems from unauthorized access and malicious activities. It emphasizes the importance of preventive measures and understanding common threats, such as human errors and network vulnerabilities. By the end, readers should be able to identify key concepts in system security and the lifecycle of network development.

## Highlights
- defining ‘system’:
- s an interdependent group of entities working together
- adhere to the three key aspects of the CIA triad
- The task of ensuring every end-point device – desktop, laptop, phone, printer – is secure is very important but also very difficult.
- the types of breaches the system is aiming to protect against.
- breach of confidentiality –
- unauthorised access
- breach of integrity –
- unauthorised modification
- breach of availability – w
- removal and/or prevention of access
- : The system should prevent all unauthorised access
- No one user should have access to a single resource and where possible resources should be available to all authorised users
- Not all users should have access to all resources. T
- there are fewer popular approaches for developing network systems. One approach is Cisco’s PPDIOO. This network lifecycle has six stages:
- t requirements gathering phase,
- e the business requirements are sought and documented in a high-level design document
- o plan the actual network
- e physical location
- . Audits of existing infrastructure
- The network design not only has to blueprint the actual build with requirements: it should account for availability, reliability, security, scalability and performance metrics
- see the network design realised in the environment. Extensive testing will take place
- monitor the network to ensure it is fully operational a
- the project team will meet to close out the project and examine the actual output to the original requirement
- Physical threats
- physical security is often overlooked
- if the server is left accessible in a shared office environment then the investment may have been for nothing.
- Common physical threats include: theft social engineering.
- Human threats
- Often, we would ‘blame’ users for issues and errors; however, the focus is shifting to the question ‘why was the user able to do xyz in the first place?’.
- even with lots of effort from the IT administrators to set up a secure environment, if this is not coupled with effective training then incidents can still occur.
- It is easy to see how locking down the system to trusted users can appear harsh and even lead to a reduction in productivity at times when access is being requested and reviewed. However, it is about the cybersecurity culture
- Common human-based threats include: insider threats social engineering.
- Operating system threats
- Common system-based threats include: exploit of vulnerabilities (zero-day issues) exploit of services to prevent usage (DoS – denial-of-service).
- To expect IT administrators to physically police the network environment is almost impossible.
- use of automation tools to monitor the network – with human intervention whenever necessary – is the more logical approach.
- MitM – man-in-the-middle attacks DDoS – distributed denial-of-service insider threats.
