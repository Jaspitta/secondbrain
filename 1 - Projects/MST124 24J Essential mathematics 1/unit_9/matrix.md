They are simply arrays of numbers, [[multi-dimensional array]]s to be precise, that can be used and treated as a single unit to facilitate some operations.
A [[matrix]] is made of rows and columns, and every single 'cell' is called an [[element]] where an m x n [[matrix]] is one that has m rows and n columns.

A [[vector]] is actually a [[matrix]] with a single column, and it is very clear when you use it the column notation to represent it.

##### [[matrix addition]]

You can add two [[matrix]] only if they have the same size and you do that by adding every respective number. A [[matrix]] can even be added to itself, every element is summed with itself and if the original [[matrix]] was called A the result will be 2A

##### [[matrix subtraction]]

Similar to [[matrix addition]], [[matrix subtraction]] can be done between two [[matrix]] of the same size and is done by subtracting every element of the second to the first. Unlike [[matrix addition]], the ordering here is important.

##### [[scalar multiplication of matrix]]

We say that the double [[matrix]] is obtained when you sum to itself a [[matrix]] giving from A to 2A. This can be extended further where the 2 can be represented by a k and the final [[matrix]] is obtained by multiplying by $k$ every element in the matrix. In this context $k$ can be referred to as the [[scalar]].
