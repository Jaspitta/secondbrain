A [[reciprocal]] of a number is that number that if we multiply for we get 1
$a*b=1$ where b is the reciprocal of a.

by following this rule we can deduce that the reciprocal is $b = 1/a$, by the same logic, when you want to divide by a fraction you can multiply by it's [[reciprocal]]. Since divisions undo multiplications we can think of $x/3 = x*(1/3)$ and in the same way $x/{(1/3)} = x*3$
