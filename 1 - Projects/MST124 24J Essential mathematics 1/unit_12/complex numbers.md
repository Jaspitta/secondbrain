They are born from the necessity of representing seemingly impossible numbers, the base of all the [[complex numbers]] is $i$ which is $+-\sqrt{-1}$ therefore $i^2=-1$.

They have very wide applications, much more than it seems, they are what made possible the creation of [[transistors]] and much more.

When working with the [[complex numbers]] $i$, sometimes it is referred to as $i=\sqrt{-1}$ but saying that $i^2=-1$ is more appropriate because the first interpretation leads to $\sqrt{-1}\sqrt{-1}=\sqrt{-1*-1}=\sqrt{1}=1$ which is of course wrong.

The term [[complex numbers]] refers in general to numbers in the form $a+bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are [[real numbers]]. Such notation express the [[real part]] as $a$ and the [[imaginary part]] as b also noted as $Re(z)=a$ and $Im(z)=b$. If a [[complex numbers]] has [[real part]] 0, it can be called an [[imaginary number]] or [[purely imaginary number]].

##### adding and subtracting [[complex numbers]]

In the simplest form, you treat $i$ as any variable like $x$ and sum the numbers with common factors.
