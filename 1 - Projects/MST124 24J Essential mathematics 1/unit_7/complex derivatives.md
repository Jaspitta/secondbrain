With complex [[derivative]] I mean all the rules that are used in [[calculus]] to deal with finding the [[derivative]] of [[function]] that include [[trigonometric raio]] and more, but at the end of the day, it is still [[differentiation]].

Remember that when dealing with [[derivative|derivatives]] of [[trigonometric function|trigonometric functions]], unless stated otherwise, the unit to consider are always [[radian|radians]].

##### [[derivative of sin]]

If you look at the [[sin graph]] you can start to have an idea of the behaviour of the gradient. The line [[tangent]] to the function seems to be 1 at the origin, than 0 at the peak of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and than negative up to -1 on $\pi$, 0 at $\frac{\pi 3}{2}$ and back to positive.
Therefore in the end the graph looks something like:

If you pay attention you notice that this is just the regular [[sin graph]] shifted to the left by $\frac{\pi}{2}$, and if you remember this is exactly the [[cos graph]] and in fact it is true that $f(x)=sinx \rightarrow f'(x)=cosx$. There is a more rigorous way to prove it mathematically but it is more complex and not necessary to remember even thought it is a good exercise [[proof_derivative_sin.pdf]]

##### [[derivative of cos]]

If you do a similar procedure to the [[derivative of sin]] to get the [[derivative of cos]] we notice that the graph looks almost like the [[sin graph]], however reflected on the [[y-axes]].
In fact $f(x)=cosx\rightarrow f'(x)=-sinx$.
Another way to deduce it is by the fact that you can obtain the graph of the [[cosine]] by translating the graph of the [[sine]] left by $\frac{\pi}{2}$ so the same can be said for the graph of the [[derivative of cos]].

##### [[derivative of tan]]

you have that $f(x)=tanx\rightarrow f'(x)=sec^2x$, remember that $sec^2x=(secx)^2$ and that $sec=\frac{1}{cos}$ so technically $f'(x)=\frac{1}{(cosx)^2}$.
