[[integral]] or [[integral calculus]] is that area of [[calculus]] that deals with the reverse process of the [[derivative]].
With [[differentiation]] you have the definition of the change of a quantity and you can get the definition of the rate of change, with [[integral|Integrals]] you do the reverse process, from the definition of a rate of change you want to get the definition of the change of the quantity.

The process of finding [[integral|integrals]] is also called [[integration]] or [[antidifferentiation]] because you start with a [[function]] $f$ and you want to find a [[function]] $F$ whose [[derivative]] is $f$.

The first problem is that any [[function]] like $f(x)=x^2+b$ will result in $f'(x)=2x$, no matter the value of b, so how can I deduce from the [[derivative]] which is the original function? First of all, we know that this situation happens because the member $+b$ represent a [[vertical translation]] which does not affect the [[gradient]], but this also means that the derivative $2x$ is represented only by this type of [[functions]] so we could way $F(x)=x^2+c$, and this is called the [[complete family of antiderivatives]] or [[indefinite integral]] and c is called [[arbitrary constant]] or [[arbitrary constant|constant of integration]].
