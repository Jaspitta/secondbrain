It simply is a graph of a [[straight-line equation]] which is an equation that when plotted in a graph gives a straight line.

One of the main properties is a [[gradient]] or [[gradient|slope]] which indicate how steep the line is, that is to say how many vertical units it moves vertically for every horizontal unit. With this in mind, if a when moving one unit horizontally the line moves up vertically the gradient is positive, if it moves n units down the [[gradient]] is negative.

Generally speaking an equation with form $y = mx$ has a [[straight-line graph]] passing through the origin with [[gradient]] x.
In the same way, an equation with form $y = mx+c$ is the same as the moving the y-[[intercepts]] by $c$ therefore moving the line vertically by $c$ units. So $y=mx+c$ has y-[[intercepts]] c and gradient m.

Since the equations in the form $y=mx+c$ makes a straight line, any equation that can be rearranged in such form is called also a [[linear equation]].

There are different ways to find the equation of a [[straight-line graph]]:
- given gradient and a point: $c = y - mx$
- given gradient and and a point: $m = \frac{y2-y1}{x2-x1}$
- given 2 points: use $m=\frac{y2-y1}{x2-x1}$ to calculate the gradient and than one of the above


Remember that two straight line are parallel if they have the same [[gradient]]

Two lines are perpendicular when their gradients multiplied gives -1. This is because if the [[gradient]] is the rise over the run, we can imagine it as a right angle triangle and flipping it a quarter would give the triangle of the perpendicular line where the run become the rise and the -rise become the run:
