In mathematics a sequence is simply a series of numbers. It can be a finite amount of them making it a [[finite sequence]] or a infinite amount making it an [[infinite sequence]] .
Usually a [[sequence]] has a patter that describe it's [[term]]s, which are the single elements, but not necessarily.

A [[sequence]] uses a [[subscript notation]] where the elements are written as $a_1, a_2, a_3 ... a_{10}$.
The full way to denote a sequence is $(a_n)^{17}_n=1$ for a [[sequence]] of 17 elements or $(a_n)^{\infty}_n$ sometimes abbreviated to $(a_n)$ to represent an infinite [[sequence]] and $n$ is just a [[dummy variable]] called [[index variable]].

##### [[closed form sequence]]

I general you can define a [[sequence]] by stating the formula for the [[nth term]] and the range, for example for perfect squares you have $1,4,9,25...$ so $s_1=1^2,s_2=2^2,s_3=3^2...$
You can see that the general formula is $s_n=n^2$ and if you add the range $(1,2,3...)$ of the subscript you have the full specification of the [[sequence]].
This type of [[sequence]], the [[closed form sequence]], gives you a formula called [[closed form formula]] which allows you to get the [[term]] n directly.
