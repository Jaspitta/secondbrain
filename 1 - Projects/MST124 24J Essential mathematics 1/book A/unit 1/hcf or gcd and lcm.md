The [[highest common factor]] is also the [[greatest common divisor]].

Also, the [[lowest common multiple]] and [[highest common factor]] of 2 numbers are are the same for their corresponding integers, for $-4,6$ are the same as for $4,6$. 

A way to find the [[highest common factor]] and [[lowest common multiple]] is to use [[prime factorization]].
You first find the [[prime factors]] of the 2 numbers, than the [[highest common factor]] is the product of the common factors with the lowest exponent, while the [[lowest common multiple]] is the product of the common and uncommon factors with the highest exponents
