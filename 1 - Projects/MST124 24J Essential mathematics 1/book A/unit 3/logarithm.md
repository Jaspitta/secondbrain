Every [[logarithm]] has a [[base]] and the simplest is the [[common logarithm]] which has base 10. Such logarithms are denoted with $\log_{10}{x}$ or sometimes simply $\log{x}$.
In general the [[base]] can be any positive number except 1 but [[logarithm]]s themselves can be any number.

As you saw, there is a special number $e$ at which the [[exponential function]] and [[logarithmic function]] have [[gradient]] 1 at (0,1), this number makes many calculations with [[logarithm]]s easier and logs in base $e$ are called [[natural logarithm]]s with notation $ln$.

As you noticed at this point, [[logarithm]] and [[exponential]]s are very much related, therefore the [[index law]]s that apply to [[exponential]]s apply to [[logarithm]]s in a similar fashion:
[[index law]]s:
$b^mb^n=b^{m+n}\ \ \ \ \frac{b^m}{b^n} = b^{m-n}\ \ \ \ (b^n)^m=b^{nm}$
[[logarithmic law]]s:
$\log_{b}{x}+\log_{b}{y}=\log_{b}{xy}\ \ \ \ \log_{b}{x}-\log_{b}{y}=\log_{b}{\frac{x}{y}}\ \ \ \ r\log_{b}{x}=\log_{b}{x^r}$

The deduction works by substitution:
