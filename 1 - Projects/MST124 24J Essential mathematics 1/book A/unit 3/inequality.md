inequalities in mathematics are statements used to usually describe some [[set]]s and is made of two expressions with an [[inequality sign]] between them (<,>,$\leq$,$\geq$).

If it is represented with x in the middle of two [[inequality sign]]s it is called a double inequality.

They are similar to [[equation]]s in many ways, but one thing that distinguish them is that [[inequality]] usually have either infinite solutions or no solutions. For this reason we define the solution to an [[inequality]] in the form of a [[set]] that is called a [[solution set]].

##### Rearranging inequality

Rearranging works similar to [[equation]]s but with some caveats. Swapping the sides and multiplying or dividing by a negative number require to swap the [[inequality sign]]. This also means that you should not divide or multiply both sides by a variable unless you know for sure that it can only take positive or negative numbers.

##### Lineal inequality

A [[linear inequality]] works very much the same way as a [[linear equation]]
