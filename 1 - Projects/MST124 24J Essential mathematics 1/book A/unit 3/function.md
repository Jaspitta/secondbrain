this is intended as a mathematical function, not a programming function, although the concepts are very related of course.

At the very core, when one quantity is dependent on another, the first quantity is a [[function]] of the second.

The part that transform input in output values is called a [[processor]], the [[set]] of possible input values is called [[domain]] and the [[set]] of possible output values is called [[codomain]]

A function is described using [[function notation]] so if there is a function that for the [[input variable]] x gives $x^2$ you can write:
$f(x)=x^2$

Every input value of a function **must** have an output value, for example in a function $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ negative numbers can not be in the [[domain]] of the function. However, not every value of the [[codomain]] has to be an output value for the function, it is common to consider a [[codomain]] that contains much more numbers.
The set of values that correspond to exactly all the possible output values id called the [[image set]].
On the other hand, every input value in the [[domain]] **must** have exactly **one** value as output in the [[codomain]]

Functions whose [[domain]] and [[codomain]] are the [[real numbers]] are called [[real functions]].

It is very important to remember that to state a function the [[domain]] must be explicit, two functions with same [[function rule]] but different [[domain]] are different functions. In some occasions the function is defined only by the [[function rule]] but that is because the [[domain]] should be the largest possible [[set]] of [[real numbers]].

Sometimes, [[function]]s can be defined simply by an [[equation]], for example, $C=2\pi r$ is considered a [[function rule]] and if we assume the [[domain]] it is an actual function.

Functions can also be defined as [[piecewise function]]s, so for different parts of its domain it will have different [[function]] rules:
$$
 f(x)=
 \begin{cases} 
      x^2 & (x\geq 0) \\
      x+5 & (x< 0).
\end{cases}
$$


Of course, functions can also be represented as [[function graph]]s, this simply means plotting the images of x under f for every element in the [[domain]]. Remember in this cases the graph is of the equation $y=f(x)$ which is the same as transforming the function in an [[equation]].

It is important to remember that a [[function]] maps [[domain]] and [[image set]] one to one, so if the graph has more than one x for a y it is not a [[function graph]]:
