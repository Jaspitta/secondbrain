this is intended as a mathematical function, not a programming function, although the concepts are very related of course.

At the very core, when one quantity is dependent on another, the first quantity is a [[function]] of the second.

The part that transform input in output values is called a [[processor]], the [[set]] of possible input values is called [[domain]] and the [[set]] of possible output values is called [[codomain]]

A function is described using [[function notation]] so if there is a function that for the [[input variable]] x gives $x^2$ you can write:
$f(x)=x^2$

Every input value of a function **must** have an output value, for example in a function $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ negative numbers can not be in the [[domain]] of the function. However, not every value of the [[codomain]] has to be an output value for the function, it is common to consider a [[codomain]] that contains much more numbers.
The set of values that correspond to exactly all the possible output values id called the [[image set]].
On the other hand, every input value in the [[domain]] **must** have exactly **one** value as output in the [[codomain]]
