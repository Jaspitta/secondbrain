in [[mathematics]] a set is simply a collection of objects.

A set can be represented mathematically by writing $S = {1,2,3,4}$ or more verbally by saying 'let S be a [[set]] of all even real numbers'.

The objects of a set are called members of a set or elements and they belong to or are in the set.

To say that an object belong to a set you can say $4 \in S$ or that it doesn't  $4 \notin S$ and to say that a set is empty you use the symbol $\oslash$ .

[[set]]s can also be combined:
- [[intersection]]: set made of all the common elements to n [[set]]s, denoted with $A\bigcap B \bigcap C ...$
- [[union]]: set made of all the elements of two sets, denoted with $A \bigcup B \bigcup C...$

These set's are usually represented visually with [[Venn diagrams]].

If every element of a [[set]] A also belong to a set B that has more elements, we say A is a [[subset]] of B or $A \subseteq B$.

a common way to visualize an [[intreval]] can also be using [[interval notation]] where you use () to represent an excluded endpoint and \[\] for an included one. So 2<x<=7 is (2,7] and if there is no limit like x<2 \[-$\infty$,2)
