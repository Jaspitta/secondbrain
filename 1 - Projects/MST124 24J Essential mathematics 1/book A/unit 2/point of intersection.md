it is nothing more than the point at witch two lines intercept.

You can find the point of intersection using algebra, the point must satisfy both equation together, the process is called [[solving equations simultaneously]] and the equations are called [[simultaneous equations]] (if they are linear they are called [[simultaneous linear equation]]).
The point that satisfy both equation is the [[point of intersection]] and is also called [[solution]].

The method to solve [[simultaneous linear equation]] are:
- [[substitution method]]: rearrange one to obtain a formula in one unknown, replace in the other, find the unknown, use it to find the other
- [[elimination method]]: multiply one or both equation so that they can be added or subtracted to eliminate one unknown, find the value of the unknown, use it to find the other

Keep in mind, if two lines have different [[gradient]] they intersect in a point. If they have same [[gradient]] and different [[y-intercepts]] they are parallel so you will not be able to solve [[simultaneous equations]]. If they have same [[gradient]] and same [[y-intercepts]]
