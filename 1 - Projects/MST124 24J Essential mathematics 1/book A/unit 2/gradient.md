In [[straight-line graph]] it is the steepness of the line in the graph, so the number of vertical units the line moves for every horizontal unit traveled.

You can calculate a gradient by:
- choose 2 points on the graph
- calculate how much x increase from first to second (run - horizontal movement)
- calculate how much y increase from first to second (rise - vertical movement)
- $gradient = \frac{rise}{run}$ which is the same as $gradient = \frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1}$
