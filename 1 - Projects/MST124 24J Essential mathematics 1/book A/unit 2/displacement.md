it is the distance from a reference point with a positive or negative sign to indicate the direction (assuming we are moving on a straight line).


If we take a point R in the middle of a line and we have a start at 60 km and end at 30 km after the reference point a car will start at 60 and end at -30. You can plot a [[straight-line graph]] for this model and it is called a [[displacement-time graph]].
In this graph we can calculate the [[gradient]] which for this situation is the [[velocity]] of the object which is its rate of change of [[displacement]] relative to time and is therefore the same as the speed but with a direction.
