The core concept is the need to describe an object in motion, to do so, in the real world for example, the [[speed]] is not enough, you need a [[direction]].
We saw a similar concept with [[displacement]] and the resulting dimension was called [[velocity]] of the object. The [[displacement]] is the combination of [[distance]] and [[direction]] so in general it works in every dimension, similarly, [[velocity]] is the combination of [[speed]] and [[direction]].

[[vector|Vectors]] are quantities that represent a [[size]] and a [[direction]] in general, they are called also [[vector|vector quantities]]. In [[vector|vectors]] the [[size]] is usually referred to as [[size|magnitude]]

The quantities we might be more used to only have a [[size]], such quantities are called [[scalar|scalars]] or [[scalar|scalar quantities]].

Vectors are often expressed with an arrow, the [[size|magnitude]] is the length of the arrow and the [[direction]] is where it points. Arrows can be used both in [[two dimensional coordinates]] systems or [[three-dimensional coordinates]] systems and the same arrow can represent two different things if you choose two different [[scales]]. However, once a scale is choose, two arrows or with the same length and direction represent the same [[vector]]

##### writing a vector

Vectors are typed as bold or handwritten as underlined so a vector v is written as **v** or <u>v</u>. Vectors that represent a [[displacement]] are called [[displacement vector]] and are represented as $\overrightarrow{PQ}$.
The magnitude of a vector **v** is represented as |**v**|

#####[[sum of vectors]]

The sum of vectors follows the rules of simply applying to an object the first and than the second vector which is called the [[triangle law for vector addition]].

It is typed simply as $\overrightarrow{AB}+\overrightarrow{BC}=\overrightarrow{AB}$ ant the resulting [[vector]] is called [[resultant]] or [[resultant|resultant vector]].
An alternative is the [[parallelogram law for vector addition]]

##### [[negative of a vector]]

Simply, given a [[vector]], the [[negative vector]] is the same with opposite [[direction]]. So what you have is that when you add a vector with it's [[negative vector]] the [[resultant]] is the [[zero vector]] you can say that $\textbf{a}+(\textbf{-a})=0$
