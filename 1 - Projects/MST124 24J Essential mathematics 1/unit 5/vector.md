The core concept is the need to describe an object in motion, to do so, in the real world for example, the [[speed]] is not enough, you need a [[direction]].
We saw a similar concept with [[displacement]] and the resulting dimension was called [[velocity]] of the object. The [[displacement]] is the combination of [[distance]] and [[direction]] so in general it works in every dimension, similarly, [[velocity]] is the combination of [[speed]] and [[direction]].

[[vector|Vectors]] are quantities that represent a [[size]] and a [[direction]] in general, they are called also [[vector|vector quantities]]. In [[vector|vectors]] the [[size]] is usually referred to as [[size|magnitude]]

The quantities we might be more used to only have a [[size]], such quantities are called [[scalar|scalars]] or [[scalar|scalar quantities]].

Vectors are often expressed with an arrow, the [[size|magnitude]] is the length of the arrow and the [[direction]] is where it points. Arrows can be used both in [[two dimensional coordinates]] systems or [[three-dimensional coordinates]] systems and the same arrow can represent two different things if you choose two different [[scales]]. However, once a scale is choose, two arrows or with the same length and direction represent the same [[vector]]

##### writing a vector

Vectors are typed as bold or handwritten as underlined so a vector v is written as **v** or <u>v</u>. Vectors that represent a [[displacement]] are called [[displacement vector]] and are represented as $\overrightarrow{PQ}$.
The magnitude of a vector **v** is represented as |**v**|

#####[[sum of vectors]]

The sum of vectors follows the rules of simply applying to an object the first and than the second vector which is called the [[triangle law for vector addition]].

It is typed simply as $\overrightarrow{AB}+\overrightarrow{BC}=\overrightarrow{AB}$ ant the resulting [[vector]] is called [[resultant]] or [[resultant|resultant vector]].
An alternative is the [[parallelogram law for vector addition]]

##### [[negative of a vector]]

Simply, given a [[vector]], the [[negative vector]] is the same with opposite [[direction]]. So what you have is that when you add a vector with it's [[negative vector]] the [[resultant]] is the [[zero vector]] you can say that $\textbf{a}+(\textbf{-a})=0$

The [[negative vector]] if what you use when you want to do [[subtraction of vectors]], you do the same as [[sum of vectors]] but you add the [[negative vector]] instead

##### [[scalar multiple]]

A scalar multiple is the product of a [[vector]] and a [[scalar]]. Simply put, the resulting is the same [[vector]] with [[magnitude]] multiplied by the [[scalar]] given, if the [[scalar]] is positive the vector maintains the [[direction]], if negative it gets reversed and it is written as $m\textbf{a}$ where m is the scalar

##### [[vector algebra]]

It is the application of regular algebra to [[vector|vectors]] and [[scalar|scalars]]. For example the order of addition of [[vector|vectors]] does not matter $a+b+c=c+a+b$, therefore we say the addition is [[cumulative]], it is also [[associative]] because $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$.
Also multiplication holds similar rules as with [[real numbers]], adding two [[scalar|scalars]] and multiply the result for a [[vector]] is the same as multiplying the [[vector]] for each [[scalar]] and adding the results at the end so $(m+n)\textbf{a}=m\textbf{a}+n\textbf{a}$, this is called [[distributive]].

Multiplication of [[vector|vectors]] can be done in two different ways but it is a bit more complicated, and division of vectors is not possible, regardless the basic algebra rules that we have defined already allow us to work with [[equation|equations]] that contains vectors, these are called [[vector equation|vector equations]]

##### working with [[vector|vectors]]

There are many ways of using [[vector|vectors]] for real life scenarios, of the most commons is to express the [[displacement]] or [[velocity]] of an object. To do this however we need a [[direction]], there are also many ways of expressing this but a common one is a [[compass bearing]], that is the angle of the direction compared to north measured clockwise (the north can be magnetic, true or on a map).
