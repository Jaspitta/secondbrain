A [[three-dimensional coordinates]] is at is's core an infinite series of [[two dimensional coordinates]].
To represent it you need another dimension, that in this case is called z.

With such you now have the three [[coordinate plane]]s, one for xy, one for xz and one for yz.

If you give the z axes a positive and negative direction, you can notice that there are actually two ways to represent an xyz system in which the x and y are flipped compared to the [[positive z direction]].
These two systems are called [[right handed coordinate system]] and [[left handed coordinate system]].
You can check the system being used with your right hand, you point your hand away from you palm up, point the middle finger to the sky, the index away from you and the thumb to the right.
If the thumb holds the [[x-axes]] you are in a [[right handed coordinate system]].
If you do the same thing with your left hand, stick your thumb to the left and your thumb hold the [[x-axes]], you are in a [[left handed coordinate system]].
You can also use the [[right-hand grip rule]], you grab the positive z axes coming from the positive y axes, if you can point your middle finger on the x axes with the right hand you are in the right handed system and if not you are int the left hand system.

##### [[distance between point in a three dimensional plane]]

The working is similar to [[distance between points in a plane]] but done twice since there is one extra dimension.
Given the two points, you can imagine a line going from one of the two down or up to form a [[right angled triangle]] with the other. Now the distance is the [[hypotenuse]] of these two points. However, the base of the triangle is a [[distance between points in a plane]]. What you can do is therefore imagine a line parallel to the [[x-axes]] and one parallel to the [[y-axes]] to form another [[right angled triangle]] of which you can get the [[hypotenuse]].
So for the first triangle you have $AB^2=AC^2+BC^2$, AC is the base so for that you have $AC^2=AD^2+DC^2$ that you can combine in $AB^2=AD^2+DC^2+BC^2$ which become $AB^2=(x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2+(z2-z1)^2$ which you can square:

##### [[sphere]]

Based on the definition we had for the [[equation of a circle]], can you guess the [[equation of a sphere]]?

The answer is that you should be somewhat able to, we said for a [[circle]] the definition is the [[locus]] of points that are at a distance of [[radius]] from the center.
If you apply the same principle to a [[three-dimensional coordinates]] system, you get a sphere.
We saw how to get the [[distance between point in a three dimensional plane]] so you can apply that to get the equation, if any point has to be distant from the center [[radius]],  we can say the equation must be $d=r$.
We know how to get the distance, so for a center in (a,b,c) the equation is $\sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2+(z-c)^2}=r$. or also $(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2+(z-c)^2=r^2$.

Just like the [[equation of a circle]], the [[equation of a sphere]] can be written in many forms, if you multiply and simplify you get the form $x^2+y^2+z^2-2ax-2by-2cz+a^2+b^2+c^2-r=0$.
