A circle is defined as the [[locus]] of points that are [[equidistant]] from a point and that distance is called the [[radius]].

It's equation can be deduced with the [[distance between points in a plane]]. If we draw a circle with center (a,b), every point P(x,y) on the circle will have the same distance, the [[radius]].
If we try to get the distance of one of the points we get $d=\sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2} \rightarrow d^2=(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2$.
This final form is actually the [[equation of a circle]].

The same [[equation]] can be rearranged in the alternative form by expanding the brackets and simplifying. Sometimes you are presented with the equations in such alternative form and you should be able to write in the original form to get quickly center and radius:
