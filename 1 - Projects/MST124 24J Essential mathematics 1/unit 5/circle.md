A circle is defined as the [[locus]] of points that are [[equidistant]] from a point and that distance is called the [[radius]].

It's equation can be deduced with the [[distance between points in a plane]]. If we draw a circle with center (a,b), every point P(x,y) on the circle will have the same distance, the [[radius]].
If we try to get the distance of one of the points we get $d=\sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2} \rightarrow d^2=(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2$.
This final form is actually the [[equation of a circle]].

The same [[equation]] can be rearranged in the alternative form by expanding the brackets and simplifying. Sometimes you are presented with the equations in such alternative form and you should be able to write in the original form to get quickly center and radius:

[[equation]]s like the once we saw for a [[circle]] are said to be in [[implicit form]] in contrast with the usual form where y is expressed in x called [[explicit form]]. The equation of a circle can not be written in [[explicit form]] as squaring both side would give a +- on the x side.

Unlike a [[straight-line equation]], if you have two points on a graph, you can have many circles that touch these points, however, if you take three points, unless they line on the same x or y, there is only one circle that passes through these three points.
The concept to find the equations is to find the center and than you can get the distance to any of the points to get the radius.
To find the center you can start by finding the [[line segment]]s that connect two pairs of the points, if you than get the [[perpendicular bisector]]s of such segments you know that those lines will meet in the center:
![[circle given three points]]
so to find the equation of a circle given three points:
- find the [[gradient]] of a pair
- find the [[midpoint]] of such pair
- find the [[gradient]] of the [[perpendicular bisector]] using [[midpoint]] and other [[gradient]]
- repeat for another pair
- solve [[simultaneous equations]] to find [[point of intersection]]
- find [[distance between points in a plane]] with center and any point
- build [[equation of a circle]]
