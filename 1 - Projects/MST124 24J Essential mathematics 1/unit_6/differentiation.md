Start by imagining a [[two dimensional coordinates]] system with a graph that represent the [[displacement]] of someone walking. If we imagine that the person get more tired the more it walks it means it will go slower an slower, therefore the graph will be a curve.

There is not [[gradient]] in a [[curve]], however, there is a [[gradient]] at each point of the [[curve]] and it changes continuously.
We saw how to calculate the [[gradient]] of a [[straight-line graph]] as $g=\frac{rise}{run}$  and this require two points on the [[x-axes]] and two points on the [[y-axes]]. But in the case of a curve we need to find the [[gradient]] of a single point so how? The answer is that you find the [[gradient]] of the [[tangent]] of the curve in such point, so the line that touches the curve only in that point and that you would obtain if you kept moving in the same direction of the gradient the origina curve had there:
![[gradient_tangent_curve]]
