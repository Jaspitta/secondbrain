Suppose that you have a house with a rounded roof, you want to know the area taken by that roof until the flat portion of the house.

What you can do is divide the colored part into rectangles and get an approximation of the area:

If you keep dividing the shape into smaller and smaller rectangles, you notice that the value of the area get closer and closer to a number. This number is called the [[limit]] of the approximation as the number of squares [[tends to infinity]].

This concept works when trying to calculate the area of any [[continuous function]].

It can happens that the shape is below the [[x-axes]], in such cases you notice that you end up with a negative area. If what you care is simply the area, you can ignore the minus sign, however it is worth making the distinction.
We call the [[signed area]] the area with the sign included, which shows weather it lays above or below the [[x-axes]]

The definition of the area of a [[continuous function]] up until know has been defined from a to b where a is less than b, however, the full definition says that the same area from b to a is the negative of the area from a to b.
This means that when calculating the [[signed area]], if there is no mention of a and b you can simply consider whether it lies above or below x, but if there is a mention and b is smaller than a you will need to flip the sign at the end.
