As we saw, [[exponential equation]]s appear in the form $b^x=c$ and can be solved using the properties of [[logarithm]]s.
The goal is to transform the x into a factor instead of an exponent, for example:
$\log_{b}{b^x}=\log_{b}{c}$ 
$x\log_{b}{b}=\log_{b}{c}$
$x=\log_bc$  , you can usually use a calculator to figure this number.
