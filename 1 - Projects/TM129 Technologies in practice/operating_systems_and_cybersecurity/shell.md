This is one component of an [[operating system]] that is used to start programs, it can be a [[CLI]] or a [[GUI]], usually an [[operating system]] provides a [[CLI]] [[shell]] very integrated with the [[operating system]] for compatibility and a more powerful recent alternative.

Regardless of the [[shell]] used the same underlying operations are performed, so the shell is actually nothing more than one way to interact with the [[operating system]]. The main objective is to allow users to run programs but at the same time the name refer to the fact that a shell actually encloses an environment partially separate from other [[shell]]s, each one has it's current folder etc.

This definition is always true but not always complete, it is for [[linux]], but other operating systems may have a shell that is much more closely integrated with the OS itself making it sometimes even not possible to change it.

There are a few terms used interchangeably to task about shells that refer to similar things but are not:
- [[terminal]]: it was a keyboard and printer connected with [[serial]] to a central computer
- [[console]]: was a type of [[terminal]], directly connected to a [[mainframe]] to read errors
- [[shell]]: this include [[GUI]], [[CLI]] and the software that allow the user to run programs
