A [[desktop environment]] is one type of [[GUI]] which is one type of [[shell]], it is characterised by the metaphor of an actual desk where you have documents and stuff to look at and move around.

Modern once get quite complicated, the key concept is that they encompass a [[window manager]] which manages the virtual separation of windows adding to it something like a [[widget toolkit]]. The [[window manager]] is what inside uses the [[GUI]] that is commonly [[X11]] or [[Wayland]] which manages the input, output and screen.

Being a [[shell]] it is technically just another [[application program]], this means that it can be replaced like any other one, especially on [[linux]].
The most common one on linux are:
- [[GNOME]]: long established [[desktop environment]] that uses the [[GTK widget toolkit]] made for [[GIMP]] associated to the [[GNU project]] and [[Red Hat Linux]], now [[GNOME]] 3 moved away from desktop and is designed for touch inputs
- [[KDE]]: long established more cross-platform [[desktop environment]] that uses the [[Qt widget toolkit]]
- [[LXDE]] 
- [[Xfce]] 

Given the huge diversity in linux developers can have a very hard time to make their applications look and work properly on all the possible environments, the [[freedesktop.org project]] helps to unite developers
