In general it refers to the act of emulating a computing device, sometimes only software sometimes all the way to the hardware.
A terminal that you normally use is actually a [[virtual terminal]] replacing the older physical one, similarly but more radically can also emulate a full [[virtual machine]].

A regular computer will run a normal [[operating system]], this is called the [[host operating system]], on the other hand when a [[virtual machine]] is run it will have a different operating system running on top called a [[guest operating system]]. Regardless of the arrangement, each operating system is isolated from the other and each has the usual [[kernel mode]] and [[user mode]] separation.

An alternative is [[containerisation]], the difference is that applications run on an isolated operating system but all share the same [[kernel]].
