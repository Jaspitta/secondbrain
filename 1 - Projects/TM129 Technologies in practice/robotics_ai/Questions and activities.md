**SAQ 3.1**

- a cruise missile as described has sensors to determine path and positions, it moves and guide itself suggesting some autonomy, overall it is a mobile, autonomous, intelligent robot
- a vacuum cleaner has in a way similar properties, it guides itself, has sensor to perceive the environment and respond to it suggesting some autonomy, overall it is a mobile, autonomous, intelligent robot

**SAQ 3.2**

- a remote controller does not operate without human intervention, it has no sensor to perceive the outside word and does not move with it's own power supply, is it even a robot?
- a self kiosk does not move and does not have it's own power supply, it does not work without human interaction, however it has some sensors to perceive the product but that's it, it may be a robot but not autonomous, mobile nor intelligent

**SAQ 5.1**
- Yes, they harm people, they obey to arm people and they do not protect their existence
- It might injure a human indadvertedly

**SAQ 6.1**
- touch, smell, hearing, seeing, the last is the dominant one
- many birds see much better than humans, dogs smell much better
- a camera can be a robot sensor, a thermometer also

**SAQ 2.1**
- will go with C
- will go with A
- avoid C
- will go with B

**SAQ 3.1**

- will go back
- about to explode

**SAQ 3.2**

**SAQ 3.4**
- engine hot is antecedent
- engine fail is consequent
- low oil is antecedent

**SAQ 3.5**
- the first two rules may suggest that if the dog is told off it is happy which contrast the third
- dogs do take a decision so I guess they have a conflict resolution strategy, listening to the owner has priority over sitting on the sofa
- they do have some level of reasoning also because the do not take always the same decision

**SAQ 4.1**
- yea

**SAQ 2.1**
- Gloria and her parents plus Robbie. Robbie is a company robot for this Child name Gloria, they play and Gloria really likes having him like a friend. People in the neighbourhood grow sceptical of robots and the mother, worried also that Gloria does not have human friends decide to get rid of Robbie. When the kid finds out she basically gets depressed, they get a dog but that does not help, they decide to move out to New York in the hope she would forget but nothing can make her forget. They decide to visit the robot factory to make her understand that Robbie was a machine, not alive, at one point Robbie is unexpectedly there, she run to him almost getting hit by a tractor in the way but Robbie being a robot is the only one fast enough to react and saves her. The parents in the end decide that the robot can stay with them
- The relation between child an robot
- In an eventual future very likely, although I hope not because a child would inevitably refuse to meet other humans with such a nice robot around

**SAQ 2.2**
- No, there is no possibility of guaranteed 100% fail-safety of any somewhat complex system
- If it existed however, yes it would probably be a good idea to add the Azimov laws to robot brains
