[[client]] and [[server]] are essentially just computers, what they differ is their role inside a network and usually the software installed in them.
[[server]] is tasked with providing information to many [[client]]s and has software to do so, the [[client]]s are required to read and display such information and have different software.

In general any [[computer]] that participate in a [[network]] is called a [[host]], it can be a [[client]], [[server]] or both.

If a [[network]] is comprised of [[computer]]s that do both the [[server]] and the [[client]], it is called a [[peer to peer]] [[network]]. A [[network]] of this type is easier to set up, cheaper as it has less components, easier to use and less complex, however it is less scalable, secure, prone to slow downs and there is not centralized administration.

You can also have a hybrid [[network]] where computers are both servers and clients but there is a central [[index server]] which store the records of which computer has which resource so the peers asks to it where to find them.
