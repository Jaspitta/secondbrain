usually consists of two [[networks]], one is a public [[network]] coming from an [[ISP]] via [[cable]] or [[DSL]], it uses a dedicated port on the [[router]] and since [[DSL]] and [[cable]] talks differently compared to an [[ethernet]] port, a [[modem]] is needed to convert one signal to the other.
The other [[network]] is the [[local network]] which can use [[ethernet]] or [[wireless]] usually.

[[Bluetooth]] uses the 2.4GHz band like some [[wireless]] but has the advantage of being low power and one to many.
