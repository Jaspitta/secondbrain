bandwith and throughput are the ways in which usually a network speed is measured to know how much [[data]]  can be transferred in how much time.

[[bandwidth]] is the theoretical maximum amount of data per second a [[network media]] is capable of transmitting usually in Kbps, Mbps or Gbps.
In the real world however, there are things that can limit the theoretical max of a [[network media]] like the amount of data being sent, the type of data and the devices in the middle, for this reason the [[throughput]] is the real maximum a [[network media]] is able to carry.
