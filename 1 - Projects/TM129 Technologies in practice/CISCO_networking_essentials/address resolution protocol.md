It is quite common for a host that wants to send a message to have the [[ip address]] of the destination but not the [[MAC address]].
Remember that the full packet will have the [[layer 2]] [[physical address]] that encapsulate the [[layer 3]] [[ip address]].

If the packet is destined for an external device, the [[MAC address]] will be simply the one of the [[default gateway]]. To be precise, when the packet reaches the [[default gateway]], this device de-encapsulate the packet, read the [[ip address]] of destination, determines the best next device to reach, replace the [[layer 2]] information with the new information of the next device and so forth, until the packet gets to destination.

To know which [[MAC address]] should be replaced in the packet knowing the [[ip address]], there is the [[address resolution protocol]] for [[IPV4]] and the [[ICMPv6 neighbor discovery]] for [[IPV6 addressing]].

When a [[host]] wants to send a packet to a [[host]] but only has the [[IPV4]] address, the first thing it does it look into the local [[ARP table]] to see if there is a match for that address, if not it sends an [[ARP request]]. This is a [[broadcast transmission]] so all devices will receive the packet, if one of the hosts in the network has the [[IPV4]] address inside the [[broadcast transmission]] it will reply with an [[ARP reply]] containing the [[MAC address]] and the requesting host will hold that information inside its local [[ARP table]].
