Nowadays organizations face more and more [[cybersecurity threats]] and need to be as ready as possible to them, the first thing to identify is the [[threat domain]] they operate in.
The most common areas an attacker can target are:
- physical
- wireless networks
- bluetooth
- emails
- weak supply chain elements
- social media
- movable storage
- cloud

We also define the following types of attacks:
- [[software attacks]]: [[DoS attack]] or a [[virus]]
- [[software error]]: bug, applications going offline, cross-site scripting
- [[sabotage]]: database penetration, [[website defacement]]
- [[human error]]: data entry, [[firewall]] misconfiguration
- [[theft]]: equipment or tools getting stolen
- [[hardware failure]]
- [[utility failure]]
- [[natural disaster]]: storms, earthquakes, floods, fires...

Another common categorisation is between [[internal threats]] like current and former employees and [[external threats]] like skilled attackers.

Usually users in the [[user domain]] represent the most common type of [[cybersecurity threats]] because no matter how secure your controls or measures are, the system will only be as secure as the people working on it:
- [[awareness of security]]: users must know and apply company [[security policy]]
- [[poorly enforced policy]]
- [[data theft]]
- [[unauthorized download]]s
- [[unauthorized VPN]]
- [[unauthorized website]]s
- [[destruction of systems or data]]

One of the worst type of threats are [[advanced persistent threats]]

The [[united states computer emergency readiness team]] and the [[united states department of homeland security]] sponsor a database of [[common vulnerabilities and exposures]] maintained by [[MITRE Corporation]] where known vulnerabilities and remediations are discovered and documented.


As suggested before, the most vulnerable part of these systems is usually people, it is therefore very commons for technical attacks to actually start as [[social attacks]] taking advantage of people using deception.
The most common types of attacks are [[social engineering]] attacks:
- [[pretexting]]
- [[quid pro quo]]
- [[identity fraud]]

Defending from [[social engineering]] attacks is more complicated than [[cybersecurity threats]], the best thing a company can do is usually train employees and raise awareness.


On a more technical level, we define malicious code as [[malware]], this however can take many forms:
- [[virus]]
- [[worm]]
- [[trojan]]
- [[logic bomb]]
- [[ransomware]]

More than ever, mobile devices are now a target for malicious actors, the most common types of attacks are:
- [[grayware]]
- [[SMiShing]]
- [[bluejacking]]
- [[bluesnarfing]]

Just as much as all the rest, websites and applications are not free from vulnearibilites:
- [[cross-site scripting]]
- [[DLL injection]]
- [[LDAP injection]]
- [[CSRF]]
