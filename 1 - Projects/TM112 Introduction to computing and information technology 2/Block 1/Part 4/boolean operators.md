simple operators used in most programming languages and more to evaluate expressions. The most basic once are AND &&, OR ||, NOT !.
Like [[arithmetic expressions]] they have an order of execution -> !, conjunction (&&), dis junction (||), and also can have parentheses to manipulate the order. It is a [[good practice]] to always include parentheses for [[boolean expression]] with more operators.
