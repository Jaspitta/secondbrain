Documentation is the action of adding further explanation to your code via [[code comments]] or other means.
Everything that is not clear just by looking at the code is a good candidate for documentation, a few obvious things are allowed types, values and units for input and output parameters. In this case for example it is useful to write in a [[code comments|code comment]] what are the boundaries for the input values, like non negative numbers and more.
When documenting more complex thing, like the [[code implementation]] of mathematical formula it might be worth considering including a link to an external resource like a [[Wikipedia]] page.

A suggestion is also to always start a program with a [[code comments|comment]] that describe the problem.
