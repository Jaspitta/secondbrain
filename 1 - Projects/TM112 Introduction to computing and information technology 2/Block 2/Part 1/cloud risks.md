It's important to remember the the cloud is not a one size fits all solution and like anything else it has downsides:

#### uptime and downtime
[[service uptime]] and [[service downtime]] are simply the time spent up or down, the cloud comes with risks of downtime due to outages, catastrophic events, scheduled downtime, demand peaks plus they run over the internet so if you lose connection to also like if they are down.

#### security
Cloud security is mostly in the hands of the [[cloud provider]] who is usually pretty good at protecting data and infrastructure. However you are always exposed to the risk of hacking, insider theft and not, plus the fact that they use [[multi-tenant]] methodology means that no matter where they access that probably will be all to reach many users

#### vendor lock-in
no matter what a [[cloud provider]] say changing cloud provider is not very easy. Larger companies have been pushing four such possibility and the situation is improving, however, cloud providers of course do not have much interest in it and therefore are very hesitant into developing such features.

#### limited control
since you do not own the infrastructure and have no control over certain aspects of the cloud this can be a strong downside

#### Jurisdiction
when it comes to data ownership the key thing is that for now the situation still remain very unclear. There are many different episodes with different outcomes, US against Microsoft holding data in Ireland, Russia no allowing data to leave the country and more. The common factor is that there is no clear law at the moment however many companies are starting to back up the [[International Communication Privacy Act]].
