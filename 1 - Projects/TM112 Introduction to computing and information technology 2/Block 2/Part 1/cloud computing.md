With its ancestors being [[utility computing]] in the 1960s, cloud computing is not new at all. However after the [[mother of all demos]] in 1968 by Douglas Engelbart people and companies started realising the potential of Personal Computers and when power increased, [[utility computing]] was for the most part abandoned.
However in recent years, with the development of the Internet, mobile devices, communication standards and software virtualisation it makes much more sense to ==use a remote server to store and process== data while you just connect to it.

Benefits of cloud computing for companies:
- No maintenance
- No limits
- Scalability
- Access from everywhere
- Pay as you go
- Central storage
- Updates, security and [[disaster recovery]]

Cloud computing has an official definition defined by [[NIST]] in 2011 and then revisited by [[ISO]] in 2014 to get to what is the final [[cloud computing definition standard]]. These 2 definition agree on 5 defining characteristics for cloud computing:
- on demand
- broad network access
- resource pooling
- [[elasticity]] and [[scalability]]
- usage monitoring

At the end of the day, the cloud is just a big [[data-centre]] somewhere and you have to keep in mind few distance from it to account for [[latency]]. In the same way [[cloud providers]] have to keep in mind the climate of the location, the humidity and more since it will affect the expenses for cooling down the location. To accommodate both parties multiple data centres are built and their general location is shared but not the exact one for security.

Not all clouds are created equal and for this reasons we say that there are many different [[types of cloud]] and some may not be considered so at all by the [[cloud computing definition standard|standard]]

We often assume that cloud services are free since you do not pay for anything, and in a way they are, however the full picture is not that simple. There is no free lunch when it comes to businesses and as you can imagine companies that offer free services have to make a profit in some way, they way they do it is usually by collecting and reselling data, that could be for ads or more things but you are still paying with your data in a way.

As we discussed the main work of a cloud provider is to make some physical resources available to multiple users, this is also defined in one of the core [[cloud computing definition standard]] with resource pooling.
The way that a cloud provider achieve this is by using [[virtualisation]] in the form of [[virtual machine|virtual machines]] which [[abstraction|abstract]] away the hardware.

The level of abstraction that is used defines at which [[cloud layer]] we are operating and it will vary depending on the needs of each customer. With each layer comes a different [[cloud service type]] that will see the same principle of [[abstraction]].

A this point you should be sold to the cloud, everything is great and works amazing right? Well like anything else remember that the cloud has it's own [[cloud risks]].

One of the key principles for a relationship between [[cloud provider]] and customer is transparency. This is achieved mostly via the [[Cloud Service Agreement]] and in particular [[Acceptable Usage Policy]] and [[Service Level Agreement]].
