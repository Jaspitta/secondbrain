README

This folder contains the textbook for M269,
the Open University module "Algorithms, data structures, computability".

FILES
-----

This book is available in 3 formats: Jupyter notebooks, PDF, and HTML.
The PDF and HTML books were automatically generated from the notebooks.
The PDF sometimes has the figure number on one page and the figure on the next.

To read the book in PDF, double-click the `M269.pdf` file in this folder.
To read the book in HTML, double-click file `index.html` in subfolder `html`.
To read the Jupyter notebooks, see the instructions on the M269 website.
Section 1.2.1 of the book explains the pros and cons of each format.

If you can't use Jupyter notebooks for some reason,
the `python` subfolder contains all the code in the notebooks,
one Python file per section of the book, unless the section has no code.
However, the code is unlikely to work as-is in traditional Python environments
because it was written with Jupyter notebooks in mind.
