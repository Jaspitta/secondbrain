### 2.4.1 Algorithms

# CELL 1

year = 2020
birth = 2010
age = year - birth

# CELL 2

year = 2020
year                # not last line, so it isn't displayed
birth = 2010
age = year - birth
age                 # last line, so it's displayed

# CELL 3

year = 2020
print(year)
birth = 2010
age = year - birth
age

### 2.4.2 Names

# CELL 4

current_year = 2020
year_of_birth = 2010
age = current_year - year_of_birth
print(age)

#### Exercise 2.4.1

#### Exercise 2.4.2

# CELL 5

# replace this by your code

### 2.4.3 Mistakes

# CELL 6
