### 3.4.5 Tests

# CELL 2

grading(0) == 5

# CELL 3

grading(39) == 5

# CELL 4

grading(40) == 4

# CELL 5

grading(49) == 4

# CELL 6

grading(50) == 3

# CELL 7

grading(59) == 3

# CELL 8

grading(60) == 2

# CELL 9

grading(79) == 2

# CELL 10

grading(80) == 1

# CELL 11

grading(100) == 1

### 3.4.6 Performance
