    "the main aim of this chapter is to practise choosing appropriate types,\n",
    "and using a combination of types when necessary.\n",

    "I suggest you do one each of the easier (Pangram and Election),\n",

    "- Develop and apply algorithms and data structures to solve computational problems – you will apply several of the ADTs and techniques you learned.\n",
    "- Explain how an algorithm or data structure works, in order to communicate with relevant stakeholders – you will be asked to outline your approach, rather than implement it.\n",
    "- Analyse the complexity of algorithms to support software design choices – you will have to suggest or evaluate alternative approaches.\n",
    "- Write readable, tested, documented and efficient Python code – you will have to add tests and use Python data types and operations.\n",
