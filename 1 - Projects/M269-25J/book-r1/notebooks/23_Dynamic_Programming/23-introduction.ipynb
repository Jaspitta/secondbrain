    "We have solved various problems in a recursive way.\n",
    "In many, the solution to a problem was obtained by solving\n",
    "*one* subproblem (i.e. a smaller instance of the same problem)\n",
    "and so the algorithm made a single recursive call.\n",
    "For example, if the problem is to obtain\n",
    "the [length of a list](../12_Recursion/12_3_length.ipynb#12.3-Length-of-a-sequence), we can solve it recursively\n",
    "by solving the subproblem of computing the length of its tail.\n",
    "Another example is [binary search](../13_Divide/13_4_binary_search.ipynb#13.4-Binary-search): to solve the problem of\n",
    "finding an item in a sorted sequence, it solves the subproblem of\n",
    "finding the item in either the left or right half (it never checks both halves).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other problems were divided into *multiple independent*\n",
    "subproblems, and we applied a divide-and-conquer algorithm that made\n",
    "as many recursive calls as there were subproblems (usually two).\n",
    "For example, [quicksort](../14_Sorting/14_6_quicksort.ipynb#14.6-Quicksort) and [merge sort](../14_Sorting/14_5_merge_sort.ipynb#14.5-Merge-sort)\n",
    "divide the input sequence into two separate parts and sort each one,\n",
    "before combining the sorted parts into a sorted sequence.\n",
    "Algorithms on [binary trees](../16_Trees/16_2_algorithms.ipynb#16.2-Algorithms-on-trees) are another example:\n",
    "they process the left and right subtrees separately and then\n",
    "combine both results with the root's item.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, some problems are naturally split into *overlapping* subproblems, where two or more subproblems have a common subproblem.\n",
    "While an algorithm with multiple recursion can elegantly solve such problems,\n",
    "it's very inefficient as it solves common subproblems repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic programming** is a technique that makes a space–time tradeoff\n",
    "to solve such problems more efficiently. It solves each subproblem only once\n",
    "and stores its solution in a subproblem–solution map. When a common subproblem\n",
    "occurs again, its solution is looked up instead of being recomputed.\n",
    "This chapter covers some classic dynamic programming problems to\n",

    "- Understand the common general-purpose data structures, algorithmic techniques and complexity classes – this chapter introduces the dynamic programming technique.\n",
