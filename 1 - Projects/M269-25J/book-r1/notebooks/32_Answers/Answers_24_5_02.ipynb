    "- Which of the templates applies to this problem?\n",

    "\n",
    "- What are the candidates and the extensions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like for Trackword, the candidates are paths in the grid\n",
    "(permutations of squares) and the extensions are the sets of unvisited squares.\n",

    "\n",
    "If the path is empty, it can be extended with any square. Otherwise it can only\n",

    "\n",
    "Any partial candidate can be a solution.\n",

    "close to the best one, so I start with a path of length one: a single square.\n",
    "Any square will do."
