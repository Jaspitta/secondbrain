    "This chapter introduces backtracking, a search technique that is\n",
    "elegant and concise (because it's recursive),\n",
    "efficient (because it can prune the search space substantially)\n",
    "and systematic (because it always follows the same template).\n",
    "The technique only applies to problems where each solution\n",
    "(and therefore each candidate) is a collection of items, because backtracking\n",
    "relies on generating each candidate incrementally, one item at a time.\n",

    "for sequences of items that satisfy some constraints.\n",
    "Section&nbsp;2 turns exhaustive search into a backtracking algorithm by making\n",

    "Section&nbsp;3&nbsp;shows a typical example of applying backtracking: solving a puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sections 4 and 5&nbsp;show how backtracking can also solve optimisation problems,\n",
    "where one best among several possible solutions is asked for,\n",
    "using the travelling salesman problem as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Sections 6 and 7 explain how to adapt backtracking to solve\n",
    "problems that are about sets of items instead of sequences of items,\n",
