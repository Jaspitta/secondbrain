    "with static arrays and other data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "A static array cannot grow, so it's convenient to distinguish\n",
    "sequences that are  **bounded**, i.e. that have a maximum length by design,\n",
    "from those that aren't.\n",
    "The length of any sequence is limited by the available memory, but bounded\n",
    "sequences have their **capacity** (maximum length) set when they're created.\n",
    "The sequence is full when its length (number of items it has) equals\n",
    "its capacity (number of items it can hold).\n",
    "When a bounded sequence is full, no item can be inserted or appended.\n",
    "A sequence with capacity zero never grows and remains empty.\n",
    "An unbounded sequence can be seen as a sequence with infinite capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing the notion of capacity forces us to change the sequence ADT\n",
    "definition. First, we should add a function to obtain a sequence's capacity.\n",
    "Second, we must change the preconditions of the insertion and append\n",
    "operations: they aren't defined for full sequences.\n",
    "Third, for operations that produce a new sequence, like slicing and concatenation, what should the capacity of the output sequence be? For example,\n",
    "when taking a slice of length *s* from a sequence with capacity *c*,\n",
    "should the capacity of the output sequence be *s*, *c* or some other value?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's difficult to decide without knowing how the slice will be used.\n",
    "It's best to add the new capacity as a further input of the operation,\n",
    "so that the user can set a meaningful value for their intended use of the slice.\n",
    "The concatenation operation should also have the capacity of the output sequence as an additional input.\n",
    "Both operations need an additional precondition for the new input:\n",
    "the capacity set by the user must be at least the length of the output, otherwise the slice or the concatenation won't fit in the new sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, the plan to implement the sequence ADT with a static array requires\n",
    "the concept of capacity, which leads to a new operation and changes to others."
