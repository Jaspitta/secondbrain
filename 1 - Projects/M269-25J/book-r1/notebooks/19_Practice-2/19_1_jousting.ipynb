    "To give his weak (but very rich and very supportive) cousin a fighting chance,\n",

    "innovation. He decreed that jousts would be carried out one after the other,\n",
    "each between the two strongest knights still in the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The monarch and his cousin reasoned that if the strong knights fight and\n",

    "The second and fourth knights fight next because now they're the strongest.\n",
    "The second knight wins and his remaining strength is 3 – 2 = 1.\n",
    "Finally, the second and third knights joust but neither wins. The output is −1."
