    "read to you, e.g. during commuting,\n",
    "but code and technical notation may be read out incorrectly.\n",
    "A PDF reader also allows you to bookmark pages, highlight passages, add notes\n",
    "and print pages, e.g. the summary section at the end of most chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTML book is read-only too. You can read it with any web browser.\n",

    "1. Vary your study environment, so that the brain gets different stimuli.\n",
    "2. Self-test regularly, e.g. with flashcards or by explaining what you learned to others.\n",
    "3. Sleep, to help the brain re-process information and build connections.\n",
    "4. If you're stuck with a problem, take a break and do something unrelated.\n",
    "5. Break up study time, to force the brain to dig up again the information and re-store it.\n",
    "6. Start a longer project as early as possible, to help the brain be attuned to\n",

    "the way you study: reading, taking notes, discussing with peers, etc.\n",
    "However, keeping re-reading and highlighting the same material, or rewriting your notes,\n",

    "Every year some M269&nbsp;students post in the forums that something they\n",
