<p>To successfully complete M269, see it as a project: it has a start and an end, goals (the learning outcomes), a schedule (the study planner) and deliverables (the TMAs). Like any project, M269 requires planning and preparation. The first step is to get to know the M269 materials, which consist of this book, three TMAs, and other resources on the <a class="reference external" href="https://learn2.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=240036">M269 website</a>.</p>
<section id="Book">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.2.1. </span>Book<a class="headerlink" href="#Book" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This book is provided in three formats: Jupyter notebooks, PDF and HTML. Each has its advantages.</p>
<p>The PDF format is read-only. Using a free PDF reader, you can read the PDF book on a tablet, use the PDF’s table of contents to jump to any subsection, and quickly search for a particular word over the whole book. Depending on the PDF reader and the accessibility settings of your computer, you can even have the book’s content read to you, e.g. during commuting, but code and technical notation may be read out incorrectly. A PDF reader also allows you to bookmark pages, highlight passages, add
notes and print pages, e.g. the summary section at the end of most chapters.</p>
<p>The HTML book is read-only too. You can read it with any web browser. As with the PDF book, you can search for any word, go directly to any section, and possibly have the content read to you. You can also bookmark and print HTML pages. Each HTML page is a complete section, corresponding to several PDF pages. You can change the font size of the HTML book with your browser’s zoom in and zoom out commands.</p>
<p>Jupyter notebooks are interactive documents that contain both text and code. I mean real, executable, editable code, not static text in a monospaced font. With notebooks, you don’t need to constantly switch between a text-only book and a programming environment. So you’ll have more time for practice. The M269 TMAs are notebooks too, to save you and your tutor time from handling separate files with the TMA questions, your answers and your code.</p>
<p>Notebooks are editable. You will edit the notebooks we provide to fix errata and to write answers to exercises and TMA questions. You may add study notes, alternative solutions, wrong solutions and comments why they’re wrong. Upon completing M269, you will have unique notebooks, with <em>your</em> answers and notes.</p>
<p>Working with Jupyter notebooks requires a laptop or desktop computer, with a proper keyboard and a decent-sized screen. There’s one Jupyter notebook per book section, to keep them relatively small. Unlike with the PDF and HTML formats, you can’t easily search for a term across all notebooks, only within a single notebook. It’s also not as easy to highlight passages and make notes in Jupyter notebooks.</p>
<p>Notebook files have the extension ‘.ipynb’, which comes from their original name: IPython notebooks. (IPython stands for interactive Python.) Do <em>not</em> double-click on a notebook to open it: this will probably open a text editor showing the internal format of a notebook. If you have double-clicked on a notebook, then immediately close the editor without changing the file. The next section explains how to install the necessary software to use notebooks. Once the software is installed, you’ll be
able to work on notebooks with a web browser.</p>
<p>If for accessibility or other reasons you can’t or don’t want to use Jupyter notebooks, you can instead use your preferred code editor with the provided Python files, one per notebook, with all the code in that notebook. Some code is specific to Jupyter, but most of it can be executed in any Python environment.</p>
<p>Most book sections have exercises. At the end of each one there’s a link to its answer. Most exercises also have a link to a hint. Each hint and answer is in a separate notebook (and separate page in the HTML version), so that you don’t accidentally see the hint or answer for the next exercise. However, the PDF version has several hints and answers on the same page. Once you have read the hint or answer in HTML or PDF, you can return to the exercise by using the ‘back’ command of your browser or
PDF app.</p>
<p>This book uses a few conventions, explained next. All formats look slightly different, due to the way the PDF and HTML books are generated from the notebooks.</p>
<p>Exercises are numbered consecutively from 1 in each section, so that you can easily refer to them in the forums and tutorials. For example, Exercise 1.3.2 is the second exercise of Section 3 of Chapter 1.</p>
<p>Besides exercises, the book has short questions to check your understanding of the concepts. Each question and its answer are separated by a horizontal line like this:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Consider the lines as ‘stop and think’ signs. At these points you should stop reading, answer the question in your head, and then continue.</p>
<p>Terms in bold, e.g. <strong>algorithm</strong>, may occur in the assessment. You must be able to understand these terms and use them in your answers. You don’t have to memorise definitions.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p><strong>Info:</strong> I use information boxes like this one to indicate alternative terms you may find in other books or on the web, to refer back to TM112, to provide the sources of exercises and data, etc. You can skip information boxes: they won’t be assessed. Information boxes look differently across book formats, but always start with ‘Info’.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I use advice boxes like this one for important teaching points, e.g. to help you solve problems and implement algorithms more effectively. Most advice boxes are in the main sections, but some appear in the solutions to exercises. Advice boxes look differently across book formats, but always start with ‘Note’.</p>

<p>An important part of your study preparation is to get into the right mindset.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, problem solving requires practice: lots of it, and regularly. There’s no recipe for solving computational problems, especially when we’re looking for the most efficient algorithm. There are general techniques, but it requires creativity to select the right one and adapt it to the problem at hand. You must view the problem from different perspectives, explore alternatives, weigh their pros and cons. Creativity is in part a systematic exploration of different approaches. There will
be dead ends and you need to give your brain a break to start afresh. It’s hard to have marathons of creativity. Think little and often about the M269 exercises. Use idle periods (like queuing) to mull over them, preferably every day.</p>
<p>As toddlers we stood up on our own, tried to walk, fell and got hurt. That didn’t stop us continuing trying and eventually succeeding. Likewise, when solving problems our initial attempts probably won’t work: our algorithms will not compute the correct output for some inputs, they won’t be efficient for large inputs, the code will crash. At such times, it’s easy to get frustrated and fed up, give up, and move to the next exercise. It’s easy and wrong. We learn more from our mistakes than from
our successes. Throughout the book I’ll give you tips on how to handle errors, but it helps from the outset if you take mistakes in your stride, as an unavoidable part of problem solving, instead of as something to despair about.</p>
<p>You should also remember that you’re not alone and that problem solving is a social activity. In professional practice, problems are solved in teams that bounce ideas around, discuss alternative designs, and look at each other’s code. You can discuss the exercises with your tutor and in the forums, ask for help, and even work on the exercises together with other students. Studying part-time at a distance can feel lonely at times, so you may wish to have some ‘study buddies’ whom you meet
regularly online or face to face.</p>
<p>Note however that you’ll have to work on the assignments by yourself. Employers need assurances that you have the knowledge and the skills to become an active player in their problem-solving teams. You can however ask for clarifications: if a question isn’t clear, contact your tutor.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Problem solving requires regular hard work, grit, resilience, and a willingness to fail and to ask for help.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.2.3. </span>Time allocation<a class="headerlink" href="#Time-allocation" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>M269 is a 30-credit module over 30 weeks, so expect to work for an average of 10 hours per week. If you’re studying part-time, I strongly advise you to do at most one other 30-credit module in parallel to M269.</p>
<p>Each week usually corresponds to one book chapter. The material gets progressively harder, so early weeks like this one don’t require 10 hours to read and work through, while others may require more.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Get ahead of the study planner whenever you can.</p>
</div>
<p>Don’t forget to plan for activities done outside the book, like installing software, participating in tutorials and forums, and working on the TMAs. This book contains several optional exercises. They are not accounted for in the workload.</p>
<p>The study planner allocates two study-free weeks to each TMA. Use them well. The corresponding book chapters don’t introduce new material: they just provide some guidance for the TMA. If you’re studying more than one module, check all the submission dates and plan your work on TMAs accordingly.</p>
<p>As part of your planning, set up study periods that fit your personal and work life pattern. Don’t fret if they get occasionally thrown off by life events: the TMA weeks give you some slack to catch up. As you study M269 and gain experience in what works best for you, be prepared to change your initial plan.</p>
<p>M269 requires (and aims to develop) two important transferable skills: coping with lots of technical information in a short period of time, and being pragmatic about what can be done to meet a deadline.</p>
</section>
<section id="Study-techniques">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.2.4. </span>Study techniques<a class="headerlink" href="#Study-techniques" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Psychology studies on how we learn have made some surprising findings over the decades. Some of the learning techniques that studies found to be effective are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Vary your study environment, so that the brain gets different stimuli.</p></li>
<li><p>Self-test regularly, e.g. with flashcards or by explaining what you learned to others.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep, to help the brain re-process information and build connections.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re stuck with a problem, take a break and do something unrelated.</p></li>
<li><p>Break up study time, to force the brain to dig up again the information and re-store it.</p></li>
<li><p>Start a longer project as early as possible, to help the brain be attuned to information that is relevant to the project.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Technique 1 is not just about varying the time and place of study, but also the way you study: reading, taking notes, discussing with peers, etc. However, keeping re-reading and highlighting the same material, or rewriting your notes, is a very passive way of learning, in which your brain is not recalling or applying the material learned. Hence the need for technique 2.</p>
<p>Every year some M269 students post in the forums that something they were struggling with suddenly ‘clicked’ after dinner or the next day, once they looked at it with ‘fresh eyes’. That’s techniques 3 and 4 at work. Note that working on a problem for 2–3 minutes doesn’t count as ‘being stuck’. The brain needs to grapple with a problem or a concept for some time and from different angles to ‘absorb’ it. There’s of course no guarantee that ‘sleeping on it’ will reveal a solution to you. Rather,
not giving enough rest to the brain will make learning harder.</p>
<p>A recurring theme emerges from the above: the brain seems to learn best when it is repeatedly engaging with the same material but in different ways and when it is given the time to process the acquired material. The brain needs to forget and be probed again to learn what is important to remember.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p><strong>Info:</strong> For more details on these techniques and the studies behind them, read Benedict Carey’s <em>How we learn</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>Studying better is not about putting in more hours, but about using the time you have available more wisely. Here are some suggestions for M269, repeating some given previously.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Don’t study 5h on one day and five on the next, for example. It’s better to split the 10 weekly hours across three or four non-consecutive days. (Technique 5)</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of listening to a tutorial recording, it’s better to spend the same time attending it and interacting with tutor and peers. (1)</p></li>
<li><p>Interleave reading and coding: that’s why M269 is delivered as Jupyter notebooks. (1)</p></li>
<li><p>If you don’t understand something after the second reading, go out of the ‘book environment’: ask your tutor, ask on the forum, attend a tutorial, do a concept map, use visualisations and other third-party material, etc. (1)</p></li>
<li><p>Do flashcards with the terms in the summary sections of each chapter. (2)</p></li>
<li><p>Attempt to answer other students’ queries on the forums, even if you’re not very sure of your answer. (2)</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t skip the stop-and-think lines or the exercises; try to do the optional ones. (2)</p></li>
<li><p>Attempt the exercises in chapters 9, 19 and 24 because they draw on material in earlier chapters, thus making you revisit concepts and apply them. (2 and 5)</p></li>
<li><p>Before working through a chapter, read (or skim again) the next TMA, to be aware of which material is most relevant. (6)</p></li>
