<p>This section briefly describes what you can expect from M269 and what is expected of you.</p>
<section id="Content">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.1.1. </span>Content<a class="headerlink" href="#Content" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Algorithms, data structures and computability have been core topics of Computing courses around the world for decades, and for a good reason. The first two topics are eminently practical: knowledge of how to structure data, construct algorithms and analyse their efficiency is useful for the design and implementation of any software system. It’s knowledge you can immediately put to use in other modules and in your professional life. The third topic is somewhat theoretical, but it is <em>the</em>
Computer Science topic. Computability addresses the fundamental questions of what computation is and what can and can’t be computed. I’m sure you will find M269 useful and intellectually stimulating.</p>
<p>M269 covers most of the core algorithm, data structure and computability topics recommended for undergraduate computing curricula by professional bodies. The first third of M269 (Chapters 2–10) explains the basic data structures and programming constructs needed for the rest of M269. Those chapters are therefore the most intensive with respect to the amount of terminology and concepts introduced, but you should know several of them from prior study. Half of M269 (Chapters 11–25) is dedicated to
algorithmic techniques, introducing further data structures, as needed. The final Chapters 26–28 are about the complexity and computability of computational problems. As in most modules, you can expect the material to get more difficult as you progress.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p><strong>Info:</strong> The recommended core topics are listed <a class="reference external" href="https://csed.acm.org/cs2013-version/">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>A recurring theme of M269 is abstraction. As you shall see later, an algorithm is an abstraction of the steps executed by a computer, data structures abstract the relationships between the data being processed, and the complexity of an algorithm is an abstraction of its run-time. Abstracting from problem-specific details leads to general models, rules and concepts that help us tackle new problems: that’s the power of abstraction. The cover of this book illustrates the abstraction process, going
from a detailed representation of a cow to a general geometric shape, the rectangle.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p><strong>Info:</strong> The cover shows Theo van Doesburg’s <a class="reference external" href="https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/inventingabstraction/?work=77">Composition VIII (The Cow)</a> and three studies leading to it, all from 1917–18. MoMA’s website has more <a class="reference external" href="https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/inventingabstraction/?work=208">drawings</a> and more information on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/inventingabstraction/?work=207">final study</a>.</p>

<p>The emphasis of M269 is computational problem solving. The module gives you techniques and a process for solving several types of problems, comparing alternative solutions, and communicating problems and solutions clearly. Many examples illustrate all of this. Much of the teaching is done through examples and exercise solutions. Study them carefully. Don’t just glance through them: make sure you understand each example and solution before moving on.</p>
<p>However, learning is not passive: it’s an activity. We don’t learn how to walk, drive a car or play a musical instrument just by watching others doing it. The only way to learn how to solve problems is to solve problems, and M269 is full of exercises for you to practise. Expect to spend most of your time figuring out how to solve a problem, trying out different approaches, analysing which one is best, writing, testing and debugging code, and documenting your solution.</p>
<p>Algorithms can be described in plain English but must be implemented in some programming language for computers to execute them. M269 uses Python because it’s an expressive, readable and uncluttered programming language.</p>
<p>M269 aims for you to develop sought-after cognitive and professional skills around problem solving, programming and communication. The intended learning outcomes of M269 are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Knowledge and understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Understand the common general-purpose data structures, algorithmic techniques and complexity classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Know about the limits of computation and their practical implications.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the Turing Machine model of computation.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Cognitive skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and apply algorithms and data structures to solve computational problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Analyse the complexity of algorithms to support software design choices.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Key skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Explain how an algorithm or data structure works, in order to communicate with relevant stakeholders.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Practical and professional skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write readable, tested, documented and efficient Python code.</p></li>
</ul>

</ul>

<section id="Challenges">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.1.2. </span>Challenges<a class="headerlink" href="#Challenges" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There’s usually a jump in pace and difficulty from Stage 1 to Stage 2 modules and M269 is among the most challenging Stage 2 Computing modules. If you don’t have experience of high-intensity study, in which you need to understand and apply many terms, concepts and techniques, you may wish to pass a Stage 2 module before starting M269.</p>
<p>M269 is challenging mainly for three reasons. First, it contains lots of material and over 5,000 lines of Python code in order to cover the recommended core topics in a single module, due to how the OU curriculum is organised. Other universities spread the M269 material (and additional topics) across two or three modules.</p>
<p>To cope with the amount of M269 material, previous students found it useful to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>use <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map">concept-mapping</a> software to organise the M269 topics and terminology</p></li>
<li><p>look at the TMAs <em>before</em> working through the corresponding chapters to gauge what to study in depth, what to skim and what to skip. The TMAs are in the <a class="reference external" href="https://learn2.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=240036&amp;area=assessment">‘Assessment’ tab</a> of the M269 website.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Second, M269 is about solving computational problems, which is inherently difficult: it requires experience, technical knowledge, persistence and creativity. No wonder good problem-solvers are sought after and well paid!</p>
<p>I’ve written parts of this book in a ‘think aloud’ style, so that you can see how I approach a problem. Another feature of this textbook is the question checklists in Chapters 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 28 to help steer you in the right direction when solving a problem.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, learning by yourself how to solve problems is difficult. Problem solving is best done together with others, to bounce off ideas and check potential solutions for errors and possible improvements. I encourage you to actively participate in the forums and tutorials. Just reading other’s posts or watching recorded tutorials doesn’t provide the same learning experience as interacting with peers and tutors.</p>
<p>Third, the M269 topics are inherently abstract and not easy to convey just with text and static figures. Understanding how code works and how it changes data in memory is not easy from just reading the code. Some students found <a class="reference external" href="http://pythontutor.com">Python tutor</a> useful to visualise the step-by-step execution of M269 code.</p>
<p>Let’s not beat about the bush: M269 is hard work and challenging. But if you put in the effort, you’ll gain conceptual and practical problem-solving skills sought by employers.</p>

<section id="Previous-knowledge">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.1.3. </span>Previous knowledge<a class="headerlink" href="#Previous-knowledge" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>I assume you have had an introduction to Python, like in TM112, and that you can write simple short programs using the following constructs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>variables, expressions and assignments</p></li>
<li><p>integers, Booleans, strings, lists and some operations on them</p></li>
<li><p>selection statements (if-elif-else and nested ifs)</p></li>
<li><p>iteration statements (while-loop, for-in-range, for-in-collection)</p></li>
<li><p>function definitions and calls.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Chapters 2 to 4 recap these constructs, but you may find the pace too fast and the explanations too brief if you don’t have Python experience. The initial chapters include new material too, so don’t skip them even if you are familiar with Python.</p>
<p>I also assume you have basic mathematical proficiency:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>you understand and know how to use percentages, powers (like <em>n</em>⁴ and 2ⁿ), logarithms and scientific notation (like 4.3×<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-8}\)</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>you can write and evaluate expressions for ‘word problems’ like calculating the service charge as a percentage of a restaurant bill</p></li>
<li><p>you can manipulate algebraic expressions, e.g. transform <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x + 4y = 20\)</span> into <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y=5 - x/4\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can check your Python and maths knowledge with the ‘Are you ready for M269’ quiz, if you haven’t done it before registering for M269. The quiz and revision resources are available from the <a class="reference external" href="https://learn2.open.ac.uk/mod/oustudyplansubpage/view.php?id=1715788">M269 page</a> of the Computing &amp; IT study site.</p>
