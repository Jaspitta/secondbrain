[[02-06-2024]]
From a [[growth]] perspective we really are not there, ==decreased sales of 3% while selling and administrative expenses are up 7%==.
They are talking about a small [[turnover]], they want to make some adjustments to get started with the next [[growth]] chapter, depends big on execution though.
[[Dividends]] and [[buybacks]] are there, and finally someone makes buybacks when the stock is down so great thing there.
Consider that they have a ==PE of 26== right now at a price around 90D, crazy times for a stock that struggle to grow.
After all this ==they say they continue to see growth of 1%==, so at least for now things are not going as they want.
They also say that the key is [[innovation]].... In shoes???
People are buying so many other shoes, look around, ==price is king== and Nikes are not cheap so where exactly will the growth come from?
