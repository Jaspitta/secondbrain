At the current time of writing the stock is in the [[90D]] range.
Over the long run it is a [[compounder]] that gave many satisfactions, if you can buy in a shorter sell of cycle you can make good money but you have to keep in mind the [[risks]].
It is a great business, and statistically this businesses in a year can drop 30% and than recover 50%, so you can play that [[volatility]] on a great business to improve your returns hugely, the classic market [[overeating cycle]].
Right now the stock is flat but the business is growing so good situation there, it is crucial to understand if the business is facing [[temporary issues]] or [[permanent issues]].
In the earnings things looks good, slightly down on revenues but still growing 8%, 5% in stores that has been open forever ([[comparable sales]]/[[comp sales]]). They are [[improving margins]], opening new stores while there is still plenty of room (less than a third of possible cities in China), so if they maintain on their promises, keep the margins and open new stores they can get to 15 to 20% growth.
They grew revenues 4 times in 15 years and even faster in net income, as we said before, the stock since 2019 did not do much.
If you count 3% for stores, 2% inflation and 2% growth you get 7% and 8B at a PE of 12, 20 if they maintain the growth which means returns of 10%.
At this point we are talking about a [[relative buy]] and also an [[absolute buy]] since the return is there, however, to get to a value investing territory we need a PE of 15 and a dividend of about 4% so you get payed to wait for those exuberant times with a great business in your hands.

Me personally it is not something I love since it gives me the idea of a business that is not perceived as a safe stock in hard macro times and is also not perceived as a great growth play in good macro times.
