Working with [[foods spices ]]and similar, they are traders not producers so they source them and sell them to others.
In the past years stock price stayed flat, meanwhile they doubled revenues made acquisitions, lowered their PE and still giving a [[dividend]] of ==6.55 at 18 price, if you add a likely growth of 4% that is a 10%== with very limited risk, and if price goes down you buy more and get to own even more for cheap.
BTW the business has been around for 100 years so it proved more than anyone else it can get through problematic situations.
The ideal situation is when you ==buy something like this at [[book value]]== which is not far from, it should get to 15 but at this point it is already a nice buy IMO
