[[17-04-2024]]
Public for 2 years from a [[spin-off]] to get rid of debt, in particular they inherited 49B of debt!!
The company is committed to paying that off and is slowly doing it actually so great job there.
Revenue are slightly down, EBITDA slightly up but free ==cash flow is almost doubled== thanks to much lower costs.
A normalized free cash flow of 5B would mean a 25% yeld, insane numbers!
However, the company is still ==[[loosing money]]==, a big big drag is depreciation and amortization (if that is the biggest thing holding down that is not really that bad IMO).
At this point they are a volatile, ==declining== (the cable part is going down and the DTC is not profitable plus not proven).
At this price to free cash flow it is definitely a [[relative buy]], if we had a glimpse of a dividend it would be also an [[absolute buy]] but it can not be a margin of safety buy because of the huge debt.
