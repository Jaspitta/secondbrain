[[03-04-2024]]
PE of 16 with 10-20% so good [[relative buy]].
Lots of client and company equity with [[no debt]].
Client equity and accounts continue to [[grow]], they continue to have very competitive prices.
Insane pre-tax [[profit margin]] of 72%, also thanks to [[interests rates]]. If those go down they make less money, but still great money nonetheless.
It is not an [[absolute buy]] simply because of the risk of interests rates that would not bankrupt the company but significantly lower the price for sure.
They thinks inflation is not as easy to defeat and this would benefit them.
Management hold 75% of shares.
No [[buybacks]] because the CEO does not plan on selling shares now and therefore does not need close term higher price, counter wall street but still good to see a CEO with such mentality, can really make a huge difference over the long run.
7% of [[dilution]] for[[share compensation]], high but not horrible and it is fair to compensate employees as they are doing a good job.
If [[interest rates]] go down and the stock is priced for the worst it is definitely a [[value investing]] buy
